Relevant Content: #### 5. Disassembly-driven design

This principle emphasizes creating products and structures that can be easily disassembled at the end of their life cycle. By designing for disassembly, we enable efficient recycling, repair and reuse of components. Imagine buildings where individual parts can be separated without causing damage. However, in the current concept, the end of life for buildings typically means demolition. Looking ahead, buildings should be designed for disassembly or deconstruction. [...] The disassembly-driven approach will also impact how we design buildings. Vertical integration of building system manufacturing, prefabrication, modular assemblies and simplification of details will be necessary to achieve disassembly-driven design. For instance, a Japanese construction company, Taisei, is using giant jacks and electricity-generating cranes to dismantle a high-rise tower—the Grand Prince Hotel Akasaka—in Tokyo, floor by floor. The company says this approach is safer, produces less noise, reduces pollution and results in 85% fewer carbon emissions. [...] Bottom Left

 materials, more and more product manufacturers are actively reducing their products’ GWP.

However, it’s essential to consider other impact categories beyond just carbon emissions when assessing circular economy practices. Reductions in GWP don’t always directly correlate with improved circular economy performance or better outcomes in other environmental impact areas. The key principle is to explore beyond carbon impact and take a holistic view of sustainability.

LEED Fellow Eddy Santosa shares the elements designers should keep in mind to achieve regenerative design goals.

Sustainable practices in building keep developing, especially through [net zero](https://www.usgbc.org/about/priorities/net-zero) goals and healthy building strategies in response to [ESG](https://www.usgbc.org/about/priorities/esg) requirements and global health concerns. The building industry keeps pushing sustainable design even further with regenerative design. Many practitioners have developed regenerative frameworks that can be used to guide the design for a regenerative building, such as [LEED](http://www.usgbc.org/leed), the AIA [Framework for Design Excellence](https://www.aia.org/design-excellence/aia-framework-design-excellence), [Mott MacDonald](https://www.mottmac.com/en-US/about-us/great-powers-of-regeneration) and [HDR](https://www.hdrinc.com/services/sustainability-resiliency/regenerative-design).

Each framework may have different requirements. For example, the Mott MacDonald Regenerative Framework is based on five categories: planet, nature, community, technology and policy. Additionally, there are 21 objectives across all categories. Darlene Gonzalez-Szabo, a senior project planner at Mott MacDonald, emphasizes that the framework serves to explore outcomes beyond net zero, addressing the changing climate and the need for sustainable and resilient infrastructure. In general, the goal of regenerative design is to reverse negative impacts and provide positive contributions to the three pillars of sustainability.

While there are many frameworks, in my view, there are five key design principles that should be implemented in designing a regenerative building, or even in pushing an existing sustainable building to achieve better outcomes.

#### 1. Ecosystem-centric design

Buildings, as abiotic components within ecosystems, interact with biotic and other abiotic factors. While solar orientation, wind and climate are commonly considered during design, we often overlook the broader impact on organisms.

To implement ecosystem-centric design, we must recognize the interconnectedness of living systems and aim to enhance ecological health by integrating natural elements and processes. The principle can be implemented by mapping the existing ecosystem and its organisms. Beyond designing landscapes that support local biodiversity, using native plants and promoting habitat restoration, a building can actively contribute to enhancing the ecosystem.

For example, [Ken Yeang showcased his approach](https://trhamzahyeang.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ken-Yeang_Desinging-for-a-Resilient-Planet.pdf) in tropical skyscraper design, incorporating five biological patterns to embed ecosystems within buildings and map their interactions. Additionally, considering the production, usage and waste of resources—including energy and water—should account for their impacts on the ecosystem, as well as for achievement of net zero goals.

#### 2. Social well-being design

User-oriented and wellness-promoting design has been a typical practice. However, to achieve regenerative design, we should implement design for social well-being that is not only oriented to individuals and building occupants, but that also enhances social interactions and diverse needs. To implement the principle, designers should add opportunities for social interaction to the surrounding area, community and city to foster community cohesion and inclusivity. This social assessment should include transportation, public space and public services, and commercial support. Additionally, LEED also includes a [social aspect](https://www.usgbc.org/credits/new-construction/v5-public-comment-1-0?return=/credits/New%20Construction/v5%20-%20Public%20Comment%201) in the draft of [LEED v5](https://www.usgbc.org/leed/v5).

#### 3. Prosperity-oriented design

Regenerative design acknowledges that economic systems are part of the larger ecosystem. It involves creating business models aligned with ecological and social goals. Regenerative buildings encourage businesses to invest in the community, create jobs and foster economic growth, with a focus on the growth of the existing local economy and quality of life. For instance, sustainable practices within construction projects can lead to increased local spending, local businesses and job opportunities.

Education also plays a pivotal role in community well-being. Prosperity-oriented design considers how educational institutions can thrive within the ecosystem. This might involve designing schools that integrate with green spaces, promoting environmental awareness and providing equitable access to education for all. By emphasizing job creation, prosperity-oriented design contributes to economic resilience. When major buildings—such as commercial centers or mixed-use developments—are constructed, they can become hubs for employment. Current residents benefit from job opportunities, leading to a positive feedback loop for the economy.

#### 4. Circular economy design

The circular economy design principle centers around closing material loops. In the context of building design, this manifests through material selection. Building materials should be intentionally designed to be either endlessly recyclable or biodegradable. The goal is to enable

March 2025 / Accepted: 27. October 2025 / Published: 24. November 2025 © The Author(s) 2025 Abstract Growing awareness of the construction industry’s substantial environmental impacts has driven increasing interest in circular and sustainable building practices. This paper presents a literature and industry scoping review of the U.S. construction sector to identify emerging trends in sustainable and circular design, with a particular focus on Design for Disassembly (DfD). DfD is defined here as the intentional design of buildings and assemblies to enable efficient modification, repair, and reuse of components at the end of their service life. Given the limited peer-reviewed research on DfD in the U.S., the review draws on a broad range of sources, including market analyses, case study reports, and governmental and corporate publications, to map relevant legislation, stakeholder engagement, and evolving industry practices. The synthesis examines stakeholder roles throughout the design process, identifies construction systems, materials, and tools that facilitate DfD, and evaluates their potential to enable material and component reuse at scale. Findings reveal significant barriers to mainstreaming DfD, including the absence of standardized material specifications for reuse, inadequate infrastructure such as storage capacity and regrading systems, and misalignment between economic incentives and legislative frameworks. At the same time, emerging initiatives in policy development, material innovation, and collaborative procurement models demonstrate opportunities for scaling DfD practices. By consolidating knowledge from both industry and academic perspectives, this paper provides a structured overview of current capabilities and constraints, offering a foundation for advancing DfD as a core strategy in transitioning the U.S. construction industry toward a more circular and resource-efficient future. Keywords Design for Disassembly · Design for Adaptability · Circular Economy · Circular Construction · Waste Reduction 1. Introduction Growing awareness of the construction industry’s substantial environmental impacts has driven increasing interest in circular and sustainable building practices. (Santoro, 2024). Within the United States, the construction industry is responsible for approximately three-quarters of raw material consumption and 1 Circular Construction Lab, 240E Sibley Hall, Department of Architecture, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States of America * Corresponding author: felix.heisel@cornell.edu Journal of Circular Economy (2025) 3:3, 296-321 297 produces approximately 600 million metric tons of construction and demolition debris (CDD) annually, of which only 20-30% is reprocessed and repurposed (US EPA, 2023). One reason is that the country’s building stock is not designed for reuse or to facilitate resource recovery (Guerra & Leite, 2021). Incentives to implement circularity in design and practice across the architecture, engineering, construction, owner/operator (AECOO) industries are catalyzed by existing and emerging legislation and policy, as well as by professional organizations such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and sustainability benchmarking foundations such as the Passive House Institute or the Living Building Challenge, which publish guidelines, reports, certifications, and other market incentives to support sustainable practices (AIA, 2023; Heisel et al., 2024). Consequently, circular and sustainable practices are maturing and increasingly approaching market implementation. Because these practices are on the brink of implementation, there is a substantial gap in peer-reviewed literature covering these newest and projected developments. This review is part of a larger study drawing on a broad range of sources, including market analyses, case study reports, and governmental and corporate publications, to map relevant legislation, stakeholder engagement, and evolving industry practices. The work aims to determine emerging trends in sustainable and circular design and construction practices and identify technologies and materials that will become relevant to the construction industry within the next ten years. This larger study identified three topics of interest: Urban Mining, Design for Disassembly and Modular Construction, aiming to contribute to the existing literature by providing general and current overviews of the potential applications of these themes in the U.S. AECOO industry. In 2024, a first review on the concept of Urban Mining in the US context was published (Heisel et al., 2024). The paper at hand builds on this first publication and specifically focuses on the concept of DfD. DfD is defined here as the intentional design of buildings and assemblies to facilitate disassembly at the end of their service life to facilitate recovery, reuse or recycling, and prevent waste generation and landfilling (ISO, 2020). The strategy employs reversible, mechanical connections and assemblies that can be taken apart so that materials and components can be reused, remanufactured and/ or recycled at their highest utility and value (EMF, 2022). DfD aims to create a materials depot of reusable construction resources in the built environment that can be accessed efficiently and reincorporated effectively. In the process, material waste due to demolition (as the opposite to systematic deconstruction or planned reassembly) is minimized, since components are documented, planned for disassembly and designed for (certified) reuse. Furthermore, repairs and adaptations of components and buildings are facilitated by DfD throughout their use time (before decommissioning) as DfD strategies incorporate or are often synonymous with design for adaptability (AIA, 2023) and design for maintenance scenarios. This synthesis examines stakeholder roles throughout the design process, identifies construction systems, materials, and tools that facilitate DfD, and evaluates their potential to enable material and component reuse at scale. By consolidating knowledge from both industry and academic perspectives, this paper provides a structured overview of current capabilities and constraints, offering a foundation for advancing DfD as a core strategy in transitioning the U.S. construction industry toward a more circular and resource-efficient future. It is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a conceptual/theoretical global background on the circular economy and circular construction; section 3 describes the methodology of the industry and literature scoping review; section 4 summarized the current understanding of DfD in the US; organized by: new stakeholders and roles (Section 4.1), required systems and architectural processes (Section 4.2), materials and connection details (Section 4.3); pertinent legislation (Section 4.4); selected case studies (Section 4.5); and tools and innovations (Section 4.6); Section 5 discusses gaps and drivers towards the application of an industrial DfD framework; Section 6 acknowledges limitations of the applied methodology; and Section 7 offers concluding remarks. 2. Conceptual/Theoretical Background Design for Disassembly (DfD) situates the AECOO industry within the circular economy’s (CE) central premise: that economic development can be decoupled from finite resource extraction by designing systems 298 Journal of Circular Economy (2025) 3:3, 296-321 in which materials circulate at their highest possible value and utility for as long as possible (Stahel, 2016). As a restorative and regenerative model, the CE rethinks the linear “take–make–dispose” paradigm, replacing it with closed-loop systems in which technical materials flow through reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling, while biological materials cycle safely back into natural systems (EMF, 2013). Theoretical foundations of the CE draw on industrial ecology, which conceptualizes material and energy flows as part of interconnected systems (Allenby, 1999); performance economy principles, which emphasize extending product lifespans and optimizing asset utilization (Stahel, 2010); and cradle-to-cradle thinking, which advances the idea of safe, perpetual material metabolisms (McDonough and Braungart, 2002). Within this framework, DfD is both a design philosophy and a technical strategy: it embeds reversibility, accessibility, and non-destructive separation into building assemblies from the outset, enabling the recovery of components for direct reuse or high-quality recycling (Bocken et al., 2016). Emerging scholarship links these conceptual underpinnings to practical interventions—such as modular construction, standardized connections, or materials passports—that facilitate component recovery and support secondary markets (Bakker et al., 2014). Recent international standards and policy instruments further institutionalize DfD by articulating measurable requirements for adaptability, maintainability, and traceability, positioning it as a critical operational lever for embedding circularity in the built environment at scale (ISO, 2020). Global statistics estimate that about 40 percent of C&D waste are being reused or recycled (Interreg Baltic Sea Region, 2025). Across the AECOO industries, these numbers vary greatly by material family and geopolitical framework: The European Union reports an average recovery rate of about 89% (Caro et al., 2024), the US publishes a “next use” rate of about 76 percent (EPA, 2024), while other regions report ranges of 3-10% and below (Ma et al., 2020). Globally, construction steel reaches a global industry-average recycling rate of about 95 percent, aluminum about 71%, while recycling of wood waste for example is estimated at only 15 percent. Importantly, these numbers are diversion statistics and thus include downcycling, backfilling and energy recovery operations. Numbers for pure recycling are generally much lower; and only limited examples of high-value and high-utility (CE definition) material recycling exist in the construction industry (e.g. H2-based steel recycling) since most post-consumer recycling processes manufacture lower-utility products from recycling feedstock (e.g. window glass to container glass, metal alloys, cascading use of wood) (Devlin et al., 2023). Considering not diversion but feedstock statistics, only 6.9 percent of the 106 billion metric tons of materials used globally come from recycled or secondary sources—a decline of 2.2 percentage points since 2015 (Circle Economy, 2025). And reuse of construction materials is generally estimated below 1 percent (Byers, 2024), although 20-30% of C&D may be suitable for reuse (Heisel et al., 2024; Skanska, 2024). DfD can be understood as a method to better match supply (salvage, disassembly) and demand (material stock) by supporting reuse as the most sustainable circular economy strategy over less direct reclamation methods, i.e. remanufacturing and recycling. DfD promotes the design of a holistic plan to enable multiple use cycles for virgin and salvaged materials that are introduced in construction. Intentionally designing for end-of-use repurposing and reuse of materials in a building is an effective way to retain economic value across several use cycles, while meeting regulation requirements and waste diversion goals, and reduce the detrimental ecological impacts of the industry with respect to material extraction/ production and associated carbon emissions. DfD helps reduce landfill volumes and emissions, prevent new resource extraction and requires less or no energy-intensive processing compared to virgin production through the design for reuse and repair (Sasidharan & Chani, 2012). Emerging legislation in the United States addresses different (partial) elements of this shift: Some policies and incentives specifically focus on the end of use of buildings, requiring the diversion of a percentage of materials or specific material groups from landfill; other legislation provides economic compensation for recycling or reuse (Heisel et al., 2024). Designs that ease the disassembly and harvest of materials at end of use with reduced energy, costs, and damage to the components work in parallel with these new requirements - however are not yet specifically addressed in code or legislation. Journal of Circular Economy (2025) 3:3, 296-321 299 3. Methodology The European, Asian, and Australian contexts offer comprehensive literature reviews, as well as articles outlining the transition to CE principles in the AECOO industries (Banihashemi et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2024; Ostapska et al., 2024; Passarelli, 2024). However, in The U.S. context, peer-reviewed publications generally highlight more specific (sub-)topics such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) strategies to evaluate sustainability impacts of DfD design scenarios (Eliote et al., 2024; Roberts et al., 2023), or low-carbon material alternatives to maximize reprocessing and recycling potentials of disassembled building components (Hu, 2023). Only two literature reviews were identified that focus more generally on DfD: However, Ostapska et al. (2024) and Rios et al. (2015) both describe limitations in sourcing scientific papers that identify practical applications of DfD, whether in built projects or firm practices, and consequently focused their analysis on case study analyses, stakeholder interviews, and the use of online search engines in their methodologies. Given the observed lag in implementing DfD at scale within the U.S. construction industry as well as the limited peer-reviewed literature on the topic within the specific geographic contest, this paper aims to provide a structured overview of current capabilities and constraints, offering a foundation for advancing DfD as a core strategy in transitioning toward a more circular and resource-efficient future by consolidating knowledge from both industry and academic perspectives. The scope of the paper is defined geographically and legally by the United States of America, and by AECOO industry activities spanning 1900 to 2050, more specifically projecting 5-10 years into the future with respect to planning and design and 30 years for policy ambitions. This paper is part of a larger, multi-year project aiming to characterize the status and readiness of the US construction industry with respect to circularity. An initial evidence inventory was conducted to identify relevant search terms for these emerging technologies, materials, and practices, using terms to restrict the search including “topics,” “trends,” “tech,” and “materials,” combined with terms related to the area of research, such as “construction,” “sustainable,” and “circular.” Webpages and publications were filtered based on the scope outlined above. These very broad results were evaluated and categorized manually in summary sheets grouped by 27 materials and 17 concepts (Heisel et al., 2023). As part of this evaluation, two variables were determined for each of the identified materials and concepts: the estimated amount of time in years to reach market maturity within the United States, and a ranking from 1-5 reflecting the expected impact on the AECOO industry (where 1 represents no-to-low impact and 5 represents high impact). These scores were determined by characteristics of each material concept, including the scale of the supply chain and product/ resource availability, progress in standardization for widespread application, and progress/ development of complementary technologies. Materials and concepts were then mapped along the x and y axis according to their quantitative variables concluded from the above characteristics: (x) time to maturity ranging from 0-10 years, and (y) impact on a scale of 1-5. Graphically mapping the materials and concepts in this way organized the results into four quadrants ranging from low impact and low time to maturity to high impact and high time to maturity. Three clusters were identified from the high impact, low time to maturity and high impact, high time to maturity quadrants for a deep dive into their application potential: Urban Mining, Design for Disassembly, and Modular Construction. Heisel et al., 2024 reviews the current state of urban mining in the U.S. AECOO industry, framing it as a critical circular economy strategy for reclaiming materials from decommissioned buildings not originally designed for disassembly. Drawing from market reports, case studies, policy documents, and industry sources, the paper maps emerging legislation, stakeholder roles, and implementation strategies, and assesses material-specific opportunities and barriers across concrete, timber, steel, glass, and brick. The study identifies key gaps—including limited documentation of building components, underdeveloped processing infrastructure, and fragmented supply chains—and highlights drivers such as waste diversion policies, adaptive reuse trends, and technological innovations in scanning, grading, and robotic processing. Case studies demonstrate how collaborative planning between deconstruction and new construction projects can maximize salvage value, while “takeaways” outline criteria for selecting suitable buildings and practices to optimize recovery. The paper concludes that advancing Urban Mining in the U.S. will require coordinated legislative, technical, and 300 Journal of Circular Economy (2025) 3:3, 296-321 market interventions, alongside the development of standardized material passports, specialized workforce skills, and design approaches that facilitate future reuse. Using a similar approach, the paper at hand focuses on the concept of Design for Disassembly within this larger project. Figure 1. Impact vs. Time for Current and Emerging Sustainable Material and Construction Practices. (Reprinted from Heisel et al., 2024). An initial review using Scopus and the search terms “circular construction” and/ or “design for disassembly,” yielded review articles that address emerging technologies and business practices in the AECOO industry globally. When refining the results by topical and geographic relevance to the United States, the resulting articles mostly describe selected materials, construction stages, or emerging tools, but do not offer general surveys of the industrial or political landscape, nor do they offer an overview of practical and applicable trends and strategies towards the implementation of DfD in future built projects and practices. Consequently, the scoping review for this paper was conducted using the search terms “circular construction” and/ or “design for disassembly” using the online search engine Google to capture a wider range of sources and source types. Filtered for geographic relevance to the US and publication dates within the past 5 years, 50 articles, reports, and industry/ product applications were selected for further analysis and comparison, spanning from material research to product development, architecture/ manufacturing company websites, organizational and institutional websites, and market reports. Furthermore, 50 legislation and project specific case study sources were identified using the same search methodology to determine the gaps between the theoretical or prototypical developments in the US AECOO industry and the legislative framework and operational infrastructures that are established to facilitate their implementation. Sections 4 synthesizes the results of this review by positioning global understandings of DfD strategies and conditions within US-specific material, industry and policy frameworks to identify local gaps and drivers of Journal of Circular Economy (2025) 3:3, 296-321 301 implementation at scale. Sections 4.1-4.3 specifically focuses on stakeholders and their roles, construction systems and material considerations with respect to DfD. Sources include the findings and reports of industry leaders, organizations, researchers, and private companies such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) which consolidates resources from 15 US government agencies for architectural practitioners.

## Abstract

Energy efficiency has become a crucial focus with the growing attention on sustainable development and decreasing energy consumption in the built environment. Different construction methods are being applied worldwide, such as conventional, modular, and 3D-printing methods, to increase energy efficiency in buildings. This study aims to enhance the decision-making process by identifying optimal construction techniques, material selection, and ventilation window dimensions to promote sustainable energy use in buildings. A novel framework combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), computational analysis, and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approaches is applied to assess the energy use intensity (EUI), annual electric energy consumption, and lifecycle energy cost across multiple sequences for each type of construction. Computational analysis in this research is combined in two main tools. Minitab is utilized for experimental design to determine the number and configurations of sequences analyzed. The Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method, applied as an MCDM tool, is used to assess and rank the performance of sequences based on equally weighted criteria. Subsequently, 3D models of case study buildings are developed, and energy simulations are conducted using Autodesk Revit and Autodesk Green Building Studio, respectively, as BIM tools to compare the energy performance of various design alternatives. The results revealed that 3D printing surpassed other methods, where Sequence 7 achieved approximately 10.3% higher efficiency than modular methods and 40.5% better performance than conventional methods in the evaluated criteria. The findings underscore the higher energy efficiency of 3D printing, followed by modular construction as a competitive method, while conventional methods lagged significantly.

## 1. Introduction

The construction industry is considered to be the major player in forming the built environment and affecting global sustainability [[1](#B1-computation-12-00247)]. Construction practices have often been responsible for high resource consumption, carbon emissions, and environmental deterioration [[2](#B2-computation-12-00247)]. Consequently, there are new trends calling for a shift towards more sustainable and energy-efficient building practices [[3](#B3-computation-12-00247)]. Recently, there has been a notable effort to adopt sustainable practices across the globe; those efforts are driven by several factors, such as environmental awareness, regulatory requirements, cost saving, climate change mitigation, and market demand [[4](#B4-computation-12-00247)].

The awareness of the environmental impact of buildings, their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, resource depletion, and waste generation has been growing in recent years [[5](#B5-computation-12-00247)]. Stakeholders involved in the construction industry started to prioritize sustainability and look for new methods to minimize their environmental imprint [[6](#B6-computation-12-00247)]. Governments and regulatory bodies also started to implement stricter building codes and standards to promote energy efficiency and sustainability in construction [[7](#B7-computation-12-00247)]. These regulations usually decree the use of local and energy-efficient materials, renewable energy resources, and green building practices [[8](#B8-computation-12-00247)].

Buildings that are considered efficient in terms of energy consumption can lead to significant cost saving during their lifecycle [[9](#B9-computation-12-00247)]. Sustainable buildings can lower operational expenses and increase property value, as they consume less energy, improve indoor air quality, and enhance occupant comfort [[10](#B10-computation-12-00247)]. Energy-efficient buildings could play a vital role in mitigating global warming by minimizing energy demand, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting renewable energy resources [[11](#B11-computation-12-00247)].

Energy efficiency is a key factor in the field of sustainable buildings, where it directly grants the ability to reduce energy consumption, operating costs, and environmental impact [[12](#B12-computation-12-00247)]. Improving the energy performance of buildings can be achieved through many means, such as efficient design, building materials, insulation materials, lighting, HVAC systems, and renewable energy integration [[13](#B13-computation-12-00247)]. Thus, the construction industry can play a pivotal role in achieving sustainability objectives and mitigating climate change.

Construction methods are another factor that can play an important role in energy performance in buildings. This factor can considerably influence the energy efficiency of buildings over their entire lifespan, including the construction, operation, and demolition phases [[14](#B14-computation-12-00247)]. Even though all construction methods have the potential to contribute to energy-efficient buildings, some specific methods can offer fundamental priorities in terms of design flexibility, insulation, airtightness, material efficiency, and sustainability. Thus, some construction methods, such as modular and 3D-printing construction, could help improve the performance of buildings in terms of energy consumption [[15](#B15-computation-12-00247)]. It is worth noting that effective application requires a precise examination of project-determined requirements, local climatic circumstances, building codes, and stakeholder concerns [[16](#B16-computation-12-00247)].

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, conventional construction has dominated the building market. Over time, conventional construction has adapted to include energy efficiency and sustainability measures in response to environmental concerns and regulatory pressures [[17](#B17-computation-12-00247)]. Numerous studies have investigated strategies and technologies to enhance the energy performance of conventional buildings. Some researchers investigated the rule of building envelope design in reducing energy consumption and environmental impact [[18](#B18-computation-12-00247),[19](#B19-computation-12-00247),[20](#B20-computation-12-00247)]. Others have studied the impact of building materials and insulation materials on energy performance [[21](#B21-computation-12-00247),[22](#B22-computation-12-00247),[23](#B23-computation-12-00247),[24](#B24-computation-12-00247)]. The impacts of window parameters and the window-to-wall ratio on thermal comfort and energy consumption have also been addressed by many researchers [[25](#B25-computation-12-00247),[26](#B26-computation-12-00247),[27](#B27-computation-12-00247)].

Modular construction, originating in the early 20th century, has evolved significantly over time. Initially driven by the need for rapid, affordable housing, it gained traction post World War II and expanded with technological advancements in the 1960s and 1970s [[28](#B28-computation-12-00247)]. Modular construction is known as off-site or pref

Relevant Content: example, the added skylights, combined with lower overall lighting intensity and lighting controls, decreased the lighting energy consumption by about 48% and saved over $2900 in annual energy costs. Table 2-2 compares some additional values between the base case and the sustainable option (prototype building). The energy-efficiency analysis of the prototype building indicates that significant amounts of energy can be reduced within an acceptable payback period and that energy-efficient buildings can have lower lifecycle costs than their traditional counterparts. The cost analysis of the Johnson City Customer Service Center being designed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (Appendix C) provides another example. 16 Incremental first cost is the additional capital expenditure needed to [...] of these energy-efficient machines for its facilities. In addition, innovative entrepreneurs have begun introducing new products that help reduce unnecessary energy consumption and have short paybacks. For example, one commercially available device reduces the electricity consumed by vending machines by up to 46% with a payback period of 1 to 2 years, while maintaining the proper temperature of the beverages or other products.22 Another important aspect of achieving energy efficiency in a new building is ""commissioning,"" which refers to the validation and checking process undertaken before the building is occupied to ensure that the performance of the building and its systems satisfies both the design intent and occupants' needs. In sustainable building design and construction, the need [...] integrated components (Loftness et al. 2002) compared with installed acoustical ceiling tile, which typically costs $1.49 to $2.31/ft2 (RS Means Company, Inc. 2002). However, the additional costs for the raised floor would most likely be offset by a lower first cost of the underfloor air-handling system compared with the traditional ceiling air-handling systems. Milam (1992) states, ""Most HVAC equipment installation occurs below the raised floor, therefore laborers perform little work on ladders, platforms, or hoists. . . . This allows substantial increases in laborer productivity that corresponds to savings in labor costs."" These underfloor air-handling systems also usually have smaller piping, pumps, and refrigeration equipment; and most of the ductwork is eliminated. In addition to

Raw Content: The Economic Benefits of Sustainable Design Evidence is growing that sustainable buildings provide financial rewards for building owners, operators, and occupants. Sustainable buildings typically have lower annual costs for energy, water, maintenance/repair, churn (reconfiguring space because of changing needs), and other operating expenses. These reduced costs do not have to come at the expense of higher first costs. Through integrated design and innovative use of sustainable materials and equipment, the first cost of a sustainable building can be the same as, or lower than, that of a traditional building. Some sustainable design features have higher first costs, but the payback period for the incremental investment often is short and the lifecycle cost typically lower than the cost of more traditional buildings. In addition to direct cost savings, sustainable buildings can provide indirect economic benefits to both the building owner and society. For instance, sustainable building features can promote better health, comfort, well-being, and productivity of building occupants, which can reduce levels of absenteeism and increase productivity. Sustainable building features can offer owners economic benefits from lower risks, longer building lifetimes, improved ability to attract new employees, reduced expenses for dealing with complaints, less time and lower costs for project permitting resulting from community acceptance and support for sustainable projects, and increased asset value. Sustainable buildings also offer society as a whole economic benefits such as reduced costs from air pollution damage and lower infrastructure costs, e.g., for avoided landfills, wastewater treatment plants, power plants, and transmission/distribution lines. Section 2.1 explains how using integrated design and various low-cost sustainable features reduces first costs. Sections 2.2 through 2.5 discuss the other direct economic benefits: annual operating cost savings for energy, water, maintenance and repair, and churn. Sections 2.6 and 2.7 discuss the indirect benefits of sustainable buildings for building owners, and Section 2.8 discusses the indirect benefits of sustainable buildings for society. Case studies and research summaries illustrating various benefits are included in each section. Lower (or Equal) First Costs Sustainable design must begin at the conceptual stage of a project to realize the full benefits. The first step is to form a design team – including the owners; architects; engineers; sustainable design consultants; landscape designers; O&M staff; health, safety and security experts; the general contractor and key subcontractors; cost consultants and value engineers; and occupant representatives. This team needs to work together from the start, seeking an ""integrated"" design. The team develops innovative solutions that meet energy, environmental, and social goals while keeping costs within budget. ""As the green design field matures, it becomes ever more clear that integration is the key to achieving energy and environmental goals especially if cost is a major driver."" Building Green Inc. (1999) Using their collective, interdisciplinary analytical capability, the team can incorporate many strategies that, taken alone, would increase first costs. For example, by improving the building envelope, the design team can often eliminate the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system around the perimeter of the building (and the associated ducting) and also downsize the primary HVAC system. Downsizing the HVAC system and eliminating ducting release money to pay for the envelope improvements. A good example of this phenomenon occurred during the 2-1 design of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s Cambria Office Building. When designers of this building first proposed an upgrade to triple-glazed, double low-e windows, the developer balked at the $15,000 increase in cost. However, the developer was won over when it was demonstrated that this upgrade would allow the perimeter-heating zone to be eliminated for a savings of $15,000, the heat pumps to be downsized for an additional $10,000 savings, and additional space to be gained because of the smaller equipment and ducts for additional rent of $5,000.8 Also, by eliminating unnecessary features (e.g., expensive finishes), the team can add some more expensive sustainable features that not only meet environmental goals but that also reduce operating costs. In a sustainable design project, the design team conducts a tradeoff exercise – trading off the cost of optional features against the cost of features that will result in energy, environmental, or social improvements. Focusing on integrated solutions and explicitly evaluating tradeoffs can result in a sustainable facility built for the same (or an even lower) cost than a more traditional building. In most of the government case studies of sustainable buildings included in this document, the first costs were not higher than the original budgeted amount. The following are some design and construction strategies that a team can use to reduce first costs:9 • Optimize site and orientation. One obvious strategy to reduce first costs is to apply appropriate siting and building orientation techniques to capture solar radiation for lighting and heating in winter and shade the building using vegetation or other site features to reduce the summer cooling load. Fully exploiting natural heating and cooling techniques can lead to smaller HVAC systems and lower first costs. • Re-use/renovate older buildings and use recycled materials. Re-using buildings, as well as using recycled materials and furnishings, saves virgin materials and reduces the energy required to produce new materials. Re-using buildings may also reduce time (and therefore money) associated with site planning and permitting. • Reduce project size. A design that is space-efficient yet adequate to meet the building objectives and requirements generally reduces the total costs, although the cost per unit area may be higher. Fully using indoor floor space and even moving certain required spaces to the exterior of the building can reduce first costs considerably. • Eliminate unnecessary finishes and features. One example of eliminating unnecessary items is choosing to eliminate ornamental wall paneling, doors (when privacy isn't critical), and drop­ ped ceilings. In some cases, removing unnecessary items can create new opportunities for designers. For example, eliminating dropped ceilings might allow deeper daylight penetration and reduce floor-to-floor height (which can reduce overall building dimensions). • Avoid structural overdesign and construction waste. Optimal value engineering and advanced framing techniques reduce material use without adversely affecting structural performance.10 Designing to minimize construction debris (e.g., using standard-sized or modular materials to avoid cutting pieces and generating less construction waste) also minimizes labor costs for cutting materials and disposing of waste. 8 ""Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Cambria Office (DEP Cambria),"" a case study in DOE's High Performance Buildings Database at http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/highperformance/case_studies/overview.cfm?ProjectID=47. 9 Many of these concepts were outlined in ""Building Green on a Budget."" Article found at http://www.betterbricks.com, which cites Environmental Building News (May 1999), a newsletter published by Building Green at http://www.buildinggreen.com. 10 These techniques are explained at http://www.toolbase.org/tertiaryT.asp?TrackID=&CategoryID=70&DocumentID=2021. 2-2 • Fully explore integrated design, including energy system optimization. As discussed above, integrated design often allows HVAC equipment to be downsized. Models such as DOE-2 allow energy performance of a prospective building to be studied and sizing of mechanical systems to be optimized. Using daylighting and operable windows for natural ventilation can reduce ""Discovering the DOE-2 model was invaluable. I can't imagine doing this kind of project without it ever again . . . h this technique, we can actually prove to our clients how much money they will be saving."" Robert Fox, Principal, Fox & Fowle, Architect of Four Times Square, http://www.betterbricks.com Wit the need for artificial lighting fixtures and mechanical cooling, lowering first costs. Beyond energy-related systems, integrated design can also reduce construction costs and shorten the schedule. For example, by involving the general contractor in early planning sessions, the design team may identify multiple ways to streamline the construction process. • Use construction waste management approaches. In some locations, waste disposal costs are very high because of declining availability of landfill capacity. For instance, in New York City, waste disposal costs about $75.00 per ton.11 In such situations, using a firm to recycle construction waste can decrease construction costs because waste is recycled at no cost to the general contractor, thereby saving disposal costs.12 (For an example, see case Study 4-2 in Section 4.) • Decrease site infrastructure. Costs can be reduced if less ground needs to be disturbed and less infrastructure needs to be built. Site infrastructure can be decreased by carefully planning the site, using natural drainage rather than storm sewers, minimizing impervious concrete side-walks, reducing the size of roads and parking lots (e.g., by locating near public transporta­ tion), using natural landscaping instead of traditional lawns, and reducing other manmade infrastructure on the site, when possible. For example, land development and infrastructure costs for the environmentally sensitive develop­ ment on Dewees Island, off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina, were 60% below average because impervious roadway surfaces and conventional landscaping were not used. ""When you don't have all these manicured landscapes and paved roads, you end up with enormous reductions in infrastructure investment."" John Knott, Chief Executive of Island Preservation Partnership, Dewee Island's developer Source: ocky Mountain Institute website http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid221.php R In addition to these strategies, certain materials and fixtures that reduce environmental impact have lower first costs than their traditional counterparts (the costs for these products are described in more detail in Appendixes D and E): • Concrete with slag content or fly ash. This product is made with a mix of Portland cement and either iron mill slag (a waste product from blast furnaces that produce iron)13 or fly ash (a waste product from coal-fired power plants). Vendor quotes gathered during this study indicate that this type of concrete can be slightly less expensive ($0.50 to $1.00 per ton less) than concrete made with 100% Portland cement and is purportedly more durable. 11 High Performance Building Guidelines: http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/ddc/html/highperf.html. 12 See http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/debris/reduce.htm. 13 The slag is recycled into ground-granulated blast furnace slag cement by grinding the iron blast furnace slag to cement fineness. 2-3 • Carpet with recycled content. A range of environmentally preferable carpet products is currently available on the market, including refurbished used carpet and new carpet made from various combinations of old carpet, carpet scraps, carpet backing, auto parts, soda bottles, and flooring materials. The quotes gathered for this study indicate that such sustainable carpet options can cost as much as $15 less per yard than traditional carpet (although some price quotes indicated the recycled carpet was more expensive). • Low-emitting paint and recycled paint. Low-emitting paint has very low or no emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when it is applied. For building occupants, the paint significantly reduces negative reactions that normal latex paint often causes and allows buildings to be occupied during or shortly after the paint is applied. Price quotes gathered for this study vary, but some indicate that low-emitting paint can cost $3 per gallon less than normal paint and can cover more surface area per gallon.14 Recycled paint is ""left-over"" paint collected from construction sites or the paint manufacturing process. That paint is then sorted by type, color, and finish and reprocessed for resale. Price quotes collected for this study indicate that recycled paint can sometimes be $15 per gallon less expensive than comparable ""virgin"" contractor-grade latex paint. • Certified wood products. Such products comply with Forest Stewardship Council Guidelines, indicating that wood producers have applied all regional laws and international treaties, respect long-term tenure, and use rights on the land from which the wood is harvested. Price quotes indicate that some certified wood doors are $150 less expensive than traditional doors (although some are more expensive). • No-water urinals. Urinals that use no flushing water often cost less to install than traditional, water-using urinals because of the reduced need for pipes (no intake water is required). Price quotes indicate that some brands of no-water urinals cost over $280 less (per urinal, installed) than their water-using counterparts. (Also, see Section 2.3 for annual water cost savings). Implementing all of the sustainable features discussed above (concrete with slag content, recycled carpet, low-emitting paint, certified wood doors, and no-water urinals) reduced the first costs of the prototype building that was examined in this study (see Section 1) by up to $2.60/ft2 and the total first cost of the building construction by as much as $51,000, lowering the total building cost by about 2%. Case Study 2-1 shows how reducing project size and using integrated design principles can significantly reduce first costs. Focusing only on strategies that keep first costs low may not be in the best long-term interest of the building owner. Some features that increase first costs can significantly reduce lifecycle costs. Some of these lifecycle cost reduction strategies are discussed in Sections 2.2 through 2.5. 14 Various brands of low-emitting paint were compared with their traditional counterparts. To provide reasonable points of comparison with the low-emitting paint, costs for both normal contractor-grade and high-end products were included. The cost of the low-emitting paint varied depending on location of the purchase, volume of the paint purchased, and the ability of the local distributor to offer special rates. 2-4 This case study shows that an integrated design team can apply fairly simple natural principles in innovative ways to significantly reduce energy consumption. A high-performance building does not necessarily cost more to build than a more typical building. One way to reduce first costs is to consider making changes to the general building program (overall concept, scope, and requirements). In this case study, exhibit space was moved outdoors. Project Description: The Zion National Park Visitors Center in Springdale, Utah, is a small building (7,600 ft2) designed to allow park visitors access to park information, interpretation, and trip-planning assistance. he facility provides both indoor and outdoor exhibit spaces. Approach to Sustainable Design: The design team used a ""whole building design"" process from the onset of the conceptual design through completion of the commissioning process. of using a two-staged T Instead design approach in which the building design is developed first, followed by the engineering design of the heating, lighting, and other mechanical systems, this design team viewed the building project as a single system. that the building envelope and systems complemented each other.
The team worked to ensure Extensive whole-building energy and lighting computer simulations were conducted throughout the design process. Sustainable Features: The building includes features such as natural ventilation and evaporative cooling, passive solar heating, daylighting and sunshading, computerized building controls, and an uninterruptible power supply integrated with a photovoltaic system. The natural ventilation and cooling are facilitated by a cooltower, a passive solar approach that has been used for hundreds of years. Water is pumped onto a honeycomb media at the top of the tower, cooling the air by evaporation. This cool air descends naturally (without fans) through the tower and into the building. Strategically placed windows help evacuate hot air and circulate the air. The building's envelope and general form, including overhangs, clerestories, roofline, and massive building materials, help reduce energy consumption. After the building envelope was designed, the small amount of remain­ ing heating required was met with electrically powered radiant heating panels, which were estimated to be the most cost-effective solution and elimi­ nated the need for a central heating system that would have required a hot-air furnace or boiler and associated ductwork or piping. Daylighting (provided by clerestory windows and windows six feet above the floor) meets the primary lighting needs, but a high-efficiency electric lighting sys­ tem and related controls were designed to complement the daylighting design. The uninterruptible power supply system was included in the original Energy-Related Features of the Visitors Center 2-5 plan for the building's electrical system because of poor power reliability at the site. The design team specified an inverter that could handle input from a solar-electric system, so the building was ready to be outfitted with a solar-electric system. Later in the design process when additional funding was available, a 7.2-kW solar-electric system was installed. The figure (previous page) shows the design's main features. Financial Considerations: The project construction cost was estimated to be about 30% less than that of a conventional visitors center. This lower cost is primarily the result of a decision made early in the design process to move many of the exhibit spaces outdoors under permanent shade structures to decrease building size. To ensure that the outdoor exhibits were noticed, the designers separated the visitors center from the restrooms (comfort station), so visitors would walk through the outdoor exhibit space. In addition, the floor space required for the building support functions (i.e., the mechanical room) was smaller than in a conventional visitors center because eliminating ducts, large blowers, chillers, and boilers reduced the size of the mechanical room. Eliminating the need for fuel storage (by using electrically powered radiant heat) also reduced infrastructure costs. The figure below summarizes annual energy costs based on measured performance (NREL monitored the performance). The building was designed to use most of its power during offpeak periods, when power is cheaper. The building's operating costs is only $0.45/ft2 ($4.84/m2) to operate. The NREL team found that the Zion Visitors Center Complex is using 70% less energy compared with facilities built to the applicable Federal codes.15 This energy use is equivalent to a total annual savings of about 250,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) (870 million Btu).

Torcellini, NREL, Golden, Colorado. 15 The 70% reduction was calculated from a theoretical base-case building, which was modeled to provide a starting point for the analysis and as a metric for evaluating the project's energy-savings success. The base-case model has the same footprint area as the as-built building. The base-case building is solar neutral (equal glaz­ ing areas on all orientations) and meets the minimum requirements of the Federal Energy Code (10 CFR 34). Electric lights provided all lighting for the base-case building and were set to retail and exhibit lighting levels. More detail on the base-case versus as-built building is available from Torcellini et al. (2002) on DOE's Energy High Performance Buildings website: http://www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/highperformance/case_studies/overview. 2-6 Annual Energy Cost Savings A wide range of building design approaches and commercially available technologies can help effectively minimize a building's energy costs. As Section 2.1 discussed, an important concept in energy-efficient design is integrating the building's architectural and mechanical features to minimize energy use and reduce cost while maintaining comfort. This integration is best done during the very early stages, when the most cost

BC Housing 1701 – 4555 Kingsway, Burnaby, British Columbia V5H 4V8, Canada ABSTRACT The residential sector accounts for the third-largest share of energy used in Canada. As a result, the government and markets have prioritized the construction of energy-efficient and high-performance residential buildings to conserve energy and minimize carbon emissions. With this increased focus on energy performance, a research study was undertaken to verify how well buildings designed to high performance rating systems performed in practice.
This research initiative investigated ten LEED Gold certified social housing buildings in Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia. The project aimed to examine the differences between how buildings performed in energy models compared to actual performance. Although some differences are expected due to fluctuations in weather and occupant behaviour, the aim was to analyze any performance gap, investigate its possible causes, seek practical solutions, and summarize recommendations for the building industry. The research involved collecting LEED energy models and over two years of energy utility data for each building. The performance gaps were analyzed by comparing predicted and actual energy consumption, examining the building characteristics, and consulting with their facility managers. Surveys with building operations staff and tenants provided additional information about each building’s performance. Of the 10 buildings, two had better actual performance then modelled (1.5% to 29.3% less energy), whereas the other eight consumed between 22.1% and 281.7% more energy than models predicted. The observed performance discrepancy is attributable to all the phases of the building life cycle, from conceptual design development to construction as well as commissioning to post-occupancy. However, a recurring issue related to lower than expected performance of air source heat pumps and differences between modelled and actual occupant behaviours.
Another potential challenge identified was the lack of awareness of the building operations staff on the buildings’ performance goals. Only two buildings’ operations staff were aware of their initial high-performance goals. The buildings operated without this knowledge showed higher energy consumption relative to their modelled predictions.
More accurate modelling of heat pumps and occupant behaviour, in addition to better equipment commissioning could help reduce differences between modelled and actual energy consumption. iii iv Design Versus Actual Energy Performance in Social Housing Buildings © BC Housing 1 INTRODUCTION iv CONTENTS Contents ABSTRACT................................................................................................................................ iii 1 Introduction......................................................................................................................... 1 2 Literature Review.

This target is in line with the federal government that is developing a “net-zero energy ready” model building code, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt it starting 2030. As shown in Figure 1.1, buildings account for around 17% of energy use in Canada of which space heating accounts for 62%. Improving energy efficiency in buildings is an essential part of governments’ climate change mitigation strategies. With this increased focus on performance, a research study was undertaken to verify how well buildings designed to high performance rating systems in the past performed in practice. Energy Use Distribution in Canada Transportation Agriculture Lighting Space Cooling Residential Appliances Water Heating Space Heating Commercial/ Institutional Industrial 40% 3% 17% 11% 29% Energy Use Distribution in Residential Sector 62% 19% 13% 4% 2% Figure 1.1: Breakdown of Overall Energy Use and Breakdown of Residential Sector Energy Use in Canada [1] LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) has been one of the most widely accepted and used green building rating systems that certify a building under seven main categories: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation in design and regional priority (for example, local environment, social equity, public health priorities, etc.). Each category gives one or more prerequisites for designers to satisfy and receive the initial assessment qualification of LEED-certified buildings. Designers then have the right to select the most applicable and preferred points to earn for their projects under various credits. With total points adding up to 100, LEED v4 buildings can qualify for four levels of efficiency certification [3]: › LEED Certified (40-49 points) › LEED Silver (50-59 points) › LEED Gold (60-79 points) › LEED Platinum (80 or more points) Passive House is another internationally recognized certification system for energy-efficient buildings that was initially developed in Germany. The modelled energy use intensity of Passive House certified buildings are often 60% lower than conventionally matched buildings, which is mostly attributable to the strict building envelope performance standards. The Passive House assessment requires a maximum 15kWh/m2 heating energy consumption per year or 10 W/m2 maximum heating load, a maximum of 120 kWh/m2 total primary energy usage each year, and a maximum of 0.6 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals pressure (ACH50) [4].
2 Design Versus Actual Energy Performance in Social Housing Buildings © BC Housing 1 INTRODUCTION The Living Building Challenge (LBC) is another very stringent rating system. Similar to the LEED rating system, LBC buildings are evaluated based on specific categories, including location, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity and aesthetics. LBC encourages three different certifications – Living Building Certification, Petal Certification and Net Zero Energy Building Certification. A score is given based on a combination of achievements in seven different categories. Unlike other systems that rely on modelled energy performance, the LBC relies on actual energy consumption data from the first year of occupancy to demonstrate compliance to the net-zero energy performance criteria.
An analysis conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) [6] in 2009 concluded that LEED buildings, in general, saved 18-39% more energy compared with their typically matched buildings. The condition of an archetype is defined by this paper comparing buildings of similar age, activity type or usage, floor area, and climate zone. A study conducted by New Buildings Institute (NBI) [7] compared the median energy use intensity (EUI) of 100 LEED buildings to the mean EUI from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) database. For these LEED buildings, the total EUI was obtained by adding up a year’s worth of billing data. The results showed that the median EUI of LEED buildings was 33% lower than the mean EUI in the CBECS database.
There can be large discrepancies between the energy performance of green buildings because different standards target different energy performance levels. A presentation at the 20th International Passive House Conference in 2016 reported that an average of 85% reduction in energy use for heating and cooling per square meter can be expected for buildings certified by the Passive House standard, which is mostly attributable to the strict certification criteria of the Passive House benchmark [8]. Also, buildings designated by the Living Building Challenge (LBC) present satisfactory results due to the LBC’s reliance on actual performance data for certification.
This study was inspired by a series of research projects that reported the performance gaps between designed versus actual energy consumption in green buildings that used different rating systems. The differences in the rating systems, evaluation of building performance, investigation of possible causes, and hidden issues related to green buildings were used as the foundation of this thesis.
Ten LEED Gold buildings constructed for BC Housing during a span of the past five to ten years are the subjects for analysis in this study. Performance assessment for these buildings was conducted post-occupation to verify if the primary design goals were realized. The examination of each building was conducted to explore reasons for the performance discrepancy and to summarize solutions for overcoming some of the observed obstacles. Surveys with tenants and building operations staff were conducted to identify issues unique to each building and to provide guidance for future building development.

LEED v4 combines the ten different rating systems of LEED 2009 into five ratings, namely: › LEED for Building Design and Construction (BD+C) › LEED for Interior Design and Construction (ID+C) › LEED for Building Operations and Maintenance (O+M) › LEED for Neighborhood Development (ND) › LEED for Homes Design and Construction Multi-family buildings with four or more stories can use LEED BD+C for certification. However, in the next version, LEED v4.1, multi-family homes of any number of stories need to use LEED v4.1 Residential. One of the main objectives of LEED v4 is to improve the use-transparency in material and resources such as material sourcing, impacts on environment and health among other metrics. Although some LEED-certified buildings meet the energy-saving criteria, material selection was not always “green.” Three new credits have been added to the Building Product Disclosure and Optimization certification to track sources of raw materials, material ingredients and product life-cycle impacts. Additionally, a new prerequisite for LEED v4 is the specification of waste treatment and recycling rates. Another valuable development of LEED v4 involves the importance of water and energy metering. In some past LEED projects, the lack of post-occupancy metering impacted performance. The new strict prerequisites ensure better building performance in energy and water efficiency. The commissioning process has been given a higher significance in LEED v4 with comprehensive prerequisites and credit specifications as well as the need for a mandatory review of the building envelope design [9].
2.1.2 Passive House vs. LEED vs. Living Building Challenge Both LEED and the Living Building Challenge standards are based on assessments for different categories. In addition to energy performance ratings, items that can have a significant impact on the certification authorization such as site and material selection, need to be evaluated and ranked. In contrast, the Passive House standard primarily focuses on the total energy consumption, heating load and airtightness level. Table 2.1 shows the comparison between the three standards.

Relevant Content: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
   Polystyrene (PS)
   Nylon (PA)
   Polypropylene (PP)

These polymers are broken down into individual high-quality monomers. These are then used to produce new polymers with the same properties as the original materials. This increases overall recycling rates and reduces the need for plastic use within the environment.

 New Recycling Technology

New recycling technologies are creating several new approaches to recycling. Recycling technologies offer an advanced practical solution to overcome the challenges faced in conventional recycling practices – working to manage waste with more precision and make progress towards conserving natural resources.

Smart Bins [...] During pyrolysis, plastics are often heated to extremely high temperatures while being starved of oxygen. This causes the materials to break down into smaller molecules of pyrolysis oil or gas. This by-product can be used both as fuel or to create new plastic products.

 By accounting for plastics that could otherwise be deemed ‘not-recyclable’ pyrolysis technology helps reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfill.

Nanotechnology

Developments in nanotechnology are also helping drive improvements in the way we recycle. Nanotechnology refers to working with materials at a small structural level to create new materials, structures and devices. [...] Smart recycling bins and AI technologies assist uptake in recycling by simplifying the recycling process. When looking to dispose of their waste, people often feel unsure about which bin or container is suitable for which item. Automatic sorting takes away this confusion and offers users peace of mind that their recycling is being processed effectively!

Pyrolysis

Pyrolysis is an innovation that converts plastic waste into usable fuel. This strand of chemical recycling allows plastic waste that can otherwise not be recycled to be transformed into an alternative resource.

Latest Recycling Innovations in 2024
====================================

[Squarebird](https://www.recyclingbristol.com/author/squarebird/ ""Posts by Squarebird"")2024-04-09T07:49:24+00:00 March 13th, 2024|

Climate change continues to pose a challenge to households and businesses worldwide. In the face of this, new and improved ways of recycling pave the way to modern-day sustainability.

While the uptake of recycling initiatives continues to increase, further advancements in recycling methods and recycling technology are required. Luckily, innovations in both of these areas are sparking exciting changes in the recycling space.

In this blog from ETM Recycling, we discuss the latest trends in recycling – including new recycled materials, new recycling methods and new recycling technologies.

For more information about recycling methods and practices, visit our blog, articles include How Schools can Reduce their Paper Waste, How to Achieve Zero Waste in Restaurants and What is a Waste Stream?

New recycled materials
----------------------

Some of the most prevalent innovations in recycling technology fall under the category of new recycled materials. In fact, new recycled materials are becoming more and more commonplace in our society’s everyday structure. Examples include:

**Recycled Bricks** – Eco bricks are an innovative solution that repurposes plastic waste for use as robust and versatile building blocks. In many instances, recycled bricks are formed from plastic bottles combined with other recycled plastic. This new material not only has environmental benefits but also offers construction engineers high degrees of insulation due to the plastic’s properties. Eco bricks not only offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional building materials, they also divert plastic waste otherwise sent to landfill.

**3D Printed Furniture** – The rise in 3D printing technology is creating exciting opportunities for eco-friendly furniture. Furniture, decorative items and art installations can all be produced using 3D printing. This innovation reduces the demand for raw materials and offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional manufacturing methods.

**Plastic Roads** – Traditional Road construction is costly and uses large volumes of raw materials. Instead, plastic roads add recycled plastic waste to asphalt mix – not only reducing raw materials but maximising the lifespan of roads and pavements too. These durable and comparatively flexible road surfaces both limit the development of cracks and potholes and reduce the wider carbon footprint of highway infrastructure.

New recycling methods
---------------------

In addition to new recycled materials, a range of new recycling methods are continuing to emerge. These include:

**Chemical Recycling**

Chemical recycling works to break down plastic into its original form. Chemical recycling as an umbrella covers a range of emerging technologies that convert plastic into recyclable materials and other products.

In its most general form – chemical recycling occurs over a number of stages, the first being conversion. In the conversion stage, long-chain hydrocarbon molecules called polymers are broken down – sometimes using a process called pyrolysis (we will talk about this more later). In the next stage – decomposition, these polymers are broken down into monomers which are used to produce new plastics.

This process is often carried out using heat or chemical solvents. In the final step – purification, materials are no longer broken down. Instead, solvents are used to separate polymers from additives or polymers.

**Organic Recycling**

Organic recycling is another new recycling method. During the organic recycling process, biodegradable plastics undergo a controlled microbiological treatment under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. This variety of recycling is only suitable for specific polymer varieties that can be converted into stabilised organic products such as carbon dioxide, methane and water.

[Learn more about managing waste sustainably >](https://www.recyclingbristol.com/how-to-manage-waste-sustainably/)

**Dissolution Recycling**

During dissolution recycling, polymers in plastic waste are dissolved in the solvents – allowing them to be separated from contaminants and purified. Dissolution recycling is particularly popular in industrial contexts – examples of which include the production of:

*   Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
*   Polystyrene (PS)
*   Nylon (PA)
*   Polypropylene (PP)

These polymers are broken down into individual high-quality monomers. These are then used to produce new polymers with the same properties as the original materials. This increases overall recycling rates and reduces the need for plastic use within the environment.

 New Recycling Technology

New recycling technologies are creating several new approaches to recycling. Recycling technologies offer an advanced practical solution to overcome the challenges faced in conventional recycling practices – working to manage waste with more precision and make progress towards conserving natural resources.

**Smart Bins**

Smart bins are revolutionising recycling, ultimately working to reduce the quantity of waste ending up in landfill. Smart bins use Different start bins utilise different technologies including sensors, connectivity features and data analytics. For some varieties, sensors are used to streamline the sorting process by detecting the variety of materials placed into the bin and sorting it accordingly.

**Artificial Intelligence**

Similarly, AI-powered technologies are helping ease the sorting process associated with recycling. AI sorting machines can be used to identify and sort different types of recyclable material which both improves the efficiency of recycling and reduces risk of contamination in the recycling stream.

Smart recycling bins and AI technologies assist uptake in recycling by simplifying the recycling process. When looking to dispose of their waste, people often feel unsure about which bin or container is suitable for which item. Automatic sorting takes away this confusion and offers users peace of mind that their recycling is being processed effectively!

**Pyrolysis**

Pyrolysis is an innovation that converts plastic waste into usable fuel. This strand of chemical recycling allows plastic waste that can otherwise not be recycled to be transformed into an alternative resource.

During pyrolysis, plastics are often heated to extremely high temperatures while being starved of oxygen. This causes the materials to break down into smaller molecules of pyrolysis oil or gas. This by-product can be used both as fuel or to create new plastic products.

 By accounting for plastics that could otherwise be deemed ‘not-recyclable’ pyrolysis technology helps reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfill.

**Nanotechnology**

Developments in nanotechnology are also helping drive improvements in the way we recycle. Nanotechnology refers to working with materials at a small structural level to create new materials, structures and devices.

Nanotechnology breaks down materials into their individual molecular parts. Doing this allows engineers to reinforce, improve or repurpose certain plastic polymers. Breaking plastics down in this way and improving them at the nano-scale layer improves their overall physical properties and maximises the opportunity for recycling and reuse within the circular economy.

**Biodegradable Plastics**

Biodegradable plastics are plastics that can be broken down naturally through environmental processes. One of the biggest challenges with plastic is the time it takes to break down if not recycled. Biodegradable plastics both reduce physical plastic pollution and the quantity of plastic waste sent to landfill.

It’s an exciting - if tumultuous - time in the world of sustainable packaging. Five years after single-use straws captured the attention of millions around the world, the packaging value chain has been hard at work forging a new path forward. Although the pandemic disrupted supply chains and put long-term innovation projects on hold, many companies moved quickly to new materials and formats. Resin manufacturers have turned to biomaterials and recycled content, converters have designed more curbside recyclable packaging, and brands and retailers have stepped up to educate their customers about packaging and waste. 

In this first-ever Innovation Trends Report, we call attention to the innovations we’re seeing from both our Member companies and the international packaging community. By highlighting some of the most promising and exciting trends in the sustainable packaging space, we aim to inspire more companies to adopt these innovations . The ultimate goal? Nothing short of widespread systems change - shepherding our industry to a future state where all packaging respects people and the planet on its journey from raw material to the next product or packaging life waiting for it. If you’re curious about where to start in your own sustainable packaging journey, join the SPC community.

We’ve been part of this change. 

Since 2017, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition has organized an annual Innovator Awards program for our Member companies, highlighting meaningful contributions towards more sustainable packaging. The Awards celebrate the outstanding collaboration behind important advancements in packaging sustainability. They’ve educated the industry on efforts to improve packaging’s environmental footprint and featured the partners - and even competitors -working together to make change possible. 

We hope these five trends don’t stay trends for long. 

Sustainable packaging leaders will be the first to capitalize on the impressive benefits of these materials and approaches, but these solutions deserve to rapidly become mainstream. 92 0 2 4 P A C K A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N S T R E N D S R E P O R T 82 0 2 4 P A C K A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N S T R E N D S R E P O R T 

# Trend 1: The “paperization” of everything 

It’s not just about cardboard anymore - fiber is tackling new frontiers. Formats that were long considered to be plastics-only territory, like pouches, candy bar wrappers, blister packs, and berry punnets, are now increasingly available in 100% fiber-based alternatives, proving that we’re in a new “paperization” era. Why paper? Part of the appeal is where it comes from - trees are a renewable resource, unlike fossil fuels. Though forests need to be managed responsibly for this to be true, in many parts of the world, they are. Fiber certification and responsible sourcing best practices have been around for decades, and are more robust than any environmental or social certifications for the responsible manufacturing or sourcing of virgin plastic. Equally important is how both consumers and legislators respond to paper. Brands may find that paper resonates better with consumers by having a more “earthy” look and feel, and is more readily associated with recyclable materials. If it ends up as litter or unmanaged waste, 100% fiber-based packaging doesn’t contribute to ocean debris and microplastics. This is part of the reason why new packaging policies like eco-modulation within extended producer responsibility (EPR) tend to favor fiber-based packaging. The biggest win for the climate comes from trees’ ability to suck carbon from the atmosphere. Forests also play a critical role in  cooling the planet, regulating local micro-climates by providing shade and transpiring water. All told, conserving forests could cut 7 billion metric tons  of carbon dioxide each year. With the “paperization” trend driving demand for responsibly-sourced fiber, forests become an investment worth protecting. As fiber-based alternatives hit their high barrier and performance targets, we can expect paper to continue to blaze new trails. 

Canopy | Atlantic Packaging and West Rock (SPC Members) 

Canopy is an alternative to current PE shrink bundling film. In many cases, the shrink bundling film is the only component of the system which is not curbside recyclable - Canopy solves that problem. This project is a Joint Development between Atlantic Packaging and West Rock. Atlantic has developed a retrofit module that lives after the existing bundler which tightens and seals the paper around the bundle of goods. West Rock brings impressive paper technology to the partnership, with a sheet which is extensible and provides compliance to the rigorous shipping stresses bundles of goods face. Utilizing Canopy versus traditional shrink also allows the manufacturer to not require an energy consuming shrink oven to be heated. 1 1 2 0 2 4 P A C K A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N S T R E N D S R E P O R T 1 0 2 0 2 4 P A C K A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N S T R E N D S R E P O R T 

# Trend 2: Ocean-based feedstocks redefine biobased packaging 

What’s sucking up carbon, growing like a weed, and more renewable than fossil fuels? Seaweed has taken center stage as one of the most exciting new materials for packaging. Also known as kelp or algae, there are thousands of species of seaweed: scientists put the estimate at 10,000 or more, each with their own unique growing regions and properties. This gives seaweed the potential to be harvested and modified for a versatile range of packaging applications. It’s not just seaweed. Other ocean-derived materials making their way into packaging include chitin (a polymer derived from the exoskeleton of crustaceans like shrimp) and simpler forms of algae. These feedstocks are already being recruited for all manner of films, foams, coatings, pellets, and polymers. In the UK, seaweed manufacturer Notpla not only won the Prince William-led Earthshot prize, but it was also recently named the “first and only” plastic-free material under the EU’s Directive on Single-Use Plastics. Because its material is naturally occurring and has not been chemically modified, Notpla has showcased how packaging can be both high-performing and an integrated part of nature. Notpla’s partnership with delivery provider Just Eat showcases seaweed’s potential as a drop-in solution for some of the most common packaging applications like takeout containers. The benefits for the planet are impressive. Ocean-based feedstocks are found around the world, can be harvested without depletion, grow rapidly without requiring land, freshwater, or synthetic fertilizers, and don’t pose problems like microplastics during disposal. Seaweed farms are already part of the climate change solution - Project Drawdown has estimated that expanding sustainable seaweed farming could sequester an additional 2.50–4.72 gigatons of carbon dioxide while generating valuable biomass feedstocks. Ocean-based feedstocks are poised to step in for fossil-fuel based plastics as versatile solutions that redefine what it means to be plastic-free. 

Home Compostable Seaweed, as seen in Retail Box Windows | Sway and EcoEnclose (SPC Members) 

Plastic windows represent a significant portion of globally used flexible films, a market valued at $65.85 billion in 2023. Together, next-generation material startup Sway and sustainable packaging supply leader EcoEnclose are reimagining windowed packaging. Their new collaboration, launched in December 2023, features Sway’s home compostable seaweed windows and EcoEnclose’s 100% recycled content kraft paper in a collection of truly impactful retail boxes. Clear, durable, and food safe, Sway seaweed windows offer an easy swap for traditional plastic windows, while being USDA certified as 100% Biobased. These windows are derived primarily from seaweed – a regenerative ocean crop that replenishes ecosystems as it grows. After use, Sway windows won’t pollute; instead, they decompose rapidly and naturally in home or industrial compost.

# Trend 3: Machine learning’s mission: getting recyclable materials to their next home 

Packaging designs have grown increasingly complex, and the latest artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help us keep up. Machine learning (using datasets and models to train machines to perform tasks that would otherwise only be possible for humans) is now being integrated with sortation robots to get cleaner, higher-value streams of recyclable material. The waste tech industry and companies like Tomra, ZenRobotics, Recycleeye, and EverestLabs are increasingly building solutions to make sense of disposed packaging materials. Machine learning is also helping to screen out non-recyclable material at recycling facilities, as well as material that needs to be recovered in a different way - for example, food and compostable materials that should instead be sent to composting facilities, or textiles that can be processed through chemical recycling technologies. Better sortation is just the beginning. Machine learning can also unlock important opportunities for chain-of-custody certification, serving as a key proofpoint that recyclability-challenged packaging formats (or a particular brands’ packaging) are, in fact, getting recycled. As more companies explore digital watermarking, a package’s ease of recyclability can be linked to a slew of product attributes, including brand, SKU, material composition and more. The circularity win is clear - by more easily and accurately identifying recyclable packaging at material recovery facilities (MRFs), we can increase their true recycling rates and get more value out of the packaging materials we already have, rather than extracting new ones. Packaging that was previously unrecognizable at material recovery facilities (MRFs) (and was screened out and sent to landfills) is now sold to reprocessors, who are turning this material into new packaging and products. AI has earned a reputation for shaking up industries, and packaging will be no exception. 

AMP Vac | AMP (SPC Member) 

AMP Vac is the waste and recycling industry’s first artificial intelligence (AI)-powered automation system for plastic film removal and recovery. Vac reliably and consistently identifies film and flexible objects, then uses an automated vacuum tube to capture and remove the material, depositing it in a configurable location. The recycling industry lacks infrastructure for the identification and separation of film and flexible packaging, and these materials jam materials recovery facility (MRF) equipment not designed to manage it. Even 2-3% film in overall MRF streams can be unmanageable to remove manually, often damaging equipment, necessitating downtime, and hindering recovery of recyclables. AMP is developing Vac to target and recover film and flexible packaging for baling and selling, which will ultimately reduce the waste generated by these materials and help to create a more circular economy for this ubiquitous packaging type.

# Trend 4: Analog + digital = the best of both worlds for recyclability labeling 

Recycling faces a uniquely modern communication problem - consumers want more information, but we’re not always sure what to make of it. This makes a clear case for putting recyclability information directly on-pack. 78% of consumers look for recyclability information on the package itself, and 82% of consumers trust that the recycling information on a product label is accurate. At the same time, “analog” on-pack labeling is limited by the amount of printable space on a package, and represents a package’s recyclability at a static point in time. Packaging policy, which varies state-by-state, is also starting to impact what can be labeled “recyclable”, and the symbols and wording that can be used. What if there was a way to share more real-time, localized, nuanced information? That’s where digital comes in. QR codes offer the opportunity to get more specific, giving consumers immediate access to recyclability instructions for their unique location. It removes the barriers of not knowing where to go to find recycling information, or not understanding exactly what local guidelines really mean. In Italy and France, new environmental labeling laws incentivize information being provided via QR codes, since information online can more easily keep up with changing packaging regulation. But QR codes can go unused by certain age groups and populations, often because of the extra steps involved. For the best of both worlds, early adopters are leveraging GreenBlue’s How2Recycle® label and The Recycling Partnership’s Recycle Check QR code programs together on product packaging. General Mills will feature Recycle Check with the How2Recycle® label on its Pillsbury Frozen Pie Crust packaging, allowing consumers to check local recycling availability for all package components by scanning a single link. Because aluminum pie trays are only accepted in approximately 40 percent of residential curbside collection programs, the QR code label provides clarity on where the item is accepted for recycling. The combined forces of the two labeling systems means more packaging getting designed to be recycled, as well as recycled in practice by consumers, thanks to prominent, actionable information about how to recycle the package. 

Joint On-Pack Recyclability Labeling | General Mills and Danone (SPC Members) 

GreenBlue’s How2Recycle program, along with The Recycling Partnership (TRP), worked together with SPC members General Mills and Danone to pilot a new dynamic packaging label feature called Recycle Check. Recycle Check draws from TRP’s National Recycling Database to allow almost any community’s residents to scan a QR code to “check locally” for recyclability information using Recycle Check’s database of recyclability information by zip code. The feature can be used with plastic, paper, metal or glass packaging, and furthers How2Recycle’s goal of using a dynamic labeling system. This pilot features the How2Recycle label alongside the Recycle Check QR code. Look for the labels on General Mills’ Pillsbury frozen pie crust packaging, Horizon Organic Milk cartons, and even more packaging coming this year.

# Trend 5: Pilots are out, a city-scale approach to reuse is in 

In the last few years, brands have learned a lot piloting new reusable and refillable packaging. Getting high consumer participation - and high return rates - has proven challenging despite widespread interest in these formats, and many brands and retailers are wondering what’s next. Recently, a new approach is starting to take hold. Cities are becoming the best drivers of reuse, offering infrastructure and solutions across sectors that build economies of scale and make it easier for consumers to engage. Take, for example, the work of the organization Perpetual. Perpetual is engaging four smaller U.S. cities - Ann Arbor, Galveston, Hilo, and Savannah - to design and implement city-scale open-loop reusable foodware systems. Their work involves mobilizing funding from public and private sources for shared reuse infrastructure and assets, outlining how individual reuse service providers will collaborate within the system, and developing a cost-sharing model for participating businesses. Where does reuse fit in the bigger effort to tackle climate change? The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s latest report outlines how scaling reuse is the biggest opportunity to reduce virgin material use in packaging: By 2040, moving from single use to reuse models could reduce the total annual amount of plastic

Where We Are Headed  35 

Additional Resources & Acknowledgements  37 The Recycling Partnership (The Partnership) has been committed to building a better recycling system since 2014. Some of our first programs focused on recycling access — expanding curbside collection and carts. Our data showed that if you had $1 to invest in recycling, improving access was the place to spend it. And the good news is that over 3,400 community recycling programs and 135 million households 

have been supported by The Partnership’s work so far, which 

includes placing 1.4 million carts to improve residential access and capacity which has diverted an estimated 770 million incremental pounds of recyclables from landfills. Why? Because while being able to recycle is a critical first 

step, recycling happens when people have the knowledge, 

confidence, and desire to recycle. Unfortunately, many Americans are confused about what and how to recycle, 

and that lack of confidence in themselves, labels, or the ultimate impacts, has grown into a lack of confidence in 

the recycling system. In fact, even if every American had 

curbside recycling, we know that over half of all residential 

materials would still be lost to landfills and one of the main reasons for that is behavior — not access. And with important legislative requirements coming from Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and content mandate laws on the horizon, we simply cannot achieve our target recycling rates without changing behavior. This is why The Partnership launched The Center for Sustainable Behavior & Impact (The Center) in 2022 — to understand the barriers, prototype solutions, and deploy behavior change resources to recycling communities across the U.S. It is the next phase in our mission to optimize the U.S. recycling system and advance the circular economy. This report summarizes all that we have learned in The Center's first year. We are moving fast to expand solutions and activate 

local recycling communities because we know there is no time to waste. And it is going to take all of us. If you are reading this, 

you have a critical role to play — whether it is implementing, advocating for, or funding this change. Get involved, and we can 

make it happen together. If this work is important to you, please also help us by sharing this report with your network in the 

recycling community.

Thank you for reading our report and your interest in learning how to help the U.S. 

recycling system reach its fullest potential through behavior change. Recycling is complex and highly interdependent, and as such, it takes a village to achieve measurable and continuous improvements. That village is made up of all of you – the individuals, communities, companies, governments, and more who are 

working all along the recycling value chain. You each have an essential role to play in making recycling work better for everyone. So, what if our village of changemakers had a shared understanding of the 

challenges, opportunities, and actions needed to influence and shift recycling 

behaviors for good? What if we could all collaborate from the same playbook? 

That is what we aim to provide with this 2023 Knowledge Report. It is a collection of research findings, yes, but more than that, it is a collection of the opportunities 

we must take to turn insights into action. Depending on which link you represent

# Executive Summary 

Recycling is often cited by Americans as the most common action taken to 

help the environment, and eight in 10 Americans report that recycling is worth 

the effort. And yet, we know that over half of household recyclables end up 

unnecessarily in the trash instead of the recycling bin. How do we close this intention-action gap? The answer is behavior change – something many in the 

industry have worked to solve for years. Though certainly a challenge, our work 

proves not only that behavior change is possible – it is happening. We have seen targeted engagement and behavior interventions cut contamination in half and increase materials collected by as much as one-third. Achieving these results requires a deep understanding of what drives behavior and then creating conditions that support the recycling behavior we want to see. The Partnership and The Center are leading the way and have set the foundation necessary for the industry to yield a true, tangible, and valuable return on investment in behavior change. We have directly observed recycling behavior in 16 people's homes, conducted over 100 in-depth interviews, surveyed more than 10,000 people across the country, and conducted 7 community pilots to 

test new strategies. Through our multi-stakeholder, evidenced-based approach, we have demonstrated that the following four key themes must be true to make 

widespread behavior change possible. 

2023 Knowledge Report | 8 recyclingpartnership.org Recycling rules change, and that is a good thing, but people do not expect change. With the pace of improvements in recycling and packaging design, we must build a 

‘communications infrastructure’ that can 

help people embrace ongoing change and make learning easy and rewarding. 

Most Americans (75%) do not recall receiving 

communications of any kind from their 

local recycling program in the past year, but the minority of people who do remember receiving communications report higher satisfaction and stronger participation behaviors. To address this gap, we are building 

a communications framework to include data-backed touchpoints along the journey from 

point of purchase to point of disposal. 

Until now, we have been able to take 

Americans’ confidence in recycling for 

granted. However, recently, that confidence is in decline, and we know there is a significant correlation between confidence and positive recycling behaviors. It is now imperative that we provide Americans more transparency with support, reassurance, and guidance to restore their confidence and protect recycling participation. 

In 2022, only half of survey respondents believe the items they place in their recycling bins are made into new products. There is 

convincing evidence that lifting back the 

curtain on recycling to demonstrate how 

and why the system works through local storytelling, tours, customer feedback, and 

more could reverse this trend.

For a long time, communities have wanted to move beyond a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Coming out of our foundational research, The Center is equipped to build the tools for a modular approach that will achieve scaled behavior change. 

At the community level, our in-field pilots show that multi-layered interventions applied 

over time are likely needed to drive behavior change. The Center’s motivational segments, 

ethnography, and BIPOC-focused research provide a strategic roadmap forward. For instance, in one application of messaging designed using motivational segments, an empathetic message aimed at destigmatizing resident confusion increased route tonnage by 38%. This intervention yielded an added seven tons of recyclables per month per route. 

Inside their homes, recyclers have created “home-grown” systems and “rules of recyclability” to decide what gets to the curb. The Center is drawing on bright spots to design trends in successful recycling behavior. Together, we must bring new thinking and behavior-centered design to alleviate the hard work of household recycling. 

There is evidence that we have not yet offered residents the right set of in-home solutions. In 2022, only 61% said that they had everything 

they needed to do a good job recycling. Pilots 

testing the distribution of in-home bins had mixed results but showed significant potential to 

boost recycling participation. Yet we know many 

homes create their own recycling processes and much more can be done to meet people where they are and finetune their current practices.

# We Can’t Fix Recycling Without Improving Recycling Behaviors 

Recycling is a complex, reverse supply chain that begins in the household and its success depends on the small, everyday 

actions of hundreds of millions of people across the country. In American kitchens and bathrooms, individuals decide 

what will be recycled or trashed, how to prepare a product for recycling, and why it might be worth the extra effort to 

recycle. If there is confusion, lack of confidence, or other barriers and friction points households are less likely to recycle 

or to recycle all that they can. 

Unfortunately, The Partnership’s data shows that there is confusion and a growing lack of confidence. According to the 

2022 Recycling Confidence Index, when shown a card with basic recycling information, 84% said it would give them more confidence in their recycling, but only one in four could remember receiving any information from their program and less than half the public (47%) said they believe their recyclables are always or usually made into new things. So, while setting up access to recycling is an important first step for improving the situation, recycling behavior change is a critical supplement to enable the ultimate act of recycling and ensure the success of expanded access. Even in households with recycling access today, only 50% of recyclable material gets recycled. Across the country, over half of residential recyclable materials lost to landfill is due to behavior gaps– amounting to 15 million tons of material each 

year. Beyond losing valuable material for future packaging, this loss also drives 63 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere and costs $834 million in landfill expenses. We also are missing a potential 17,500 jobs that would 

be generated if this material were captured in the recycling system. 

Even in households with recycling access, only 50% of available recyclable materials are captured. 

2023 Knowledge Report | 11 recyclingpartnership.org If we want to fix recycling, we need to deeply understand the barriers, motivators, and friction points and find new ways to change recycling behavior. And we need to do it now. In addition to the mounting economic and environmental costs, extended producer responsibility (EPR) legislation adds to our 

already urgent need to unlock behavior change. Manufacturers will soon be held responsible for 

reaching ambitious target recycling rates and incorporating post-consumer recycled content (PCR) into 

their packaging. To achieve this, we need proven best practices for driving increased participation in 

recycling that will lead to higher recycling rates and increased availability of recycled content. 

But what exactly is behavior change? 

Behavior change is a critical step to increase recycling rates, but how exactly can we get people to act differently and change habits for good? Education and communications are often part of the solution, but there is a significant base of research that shows awareness and education alone do not change behaviors. 

Behavior change is a social science that dives deep into what makes an audience tick, uncovers where 

their friction points are, and provides (often simple) solutions that help people change.

At the end of the 20th century, individuals suddenly had greater responsibility for their own retirement income security due to the relatively low social security income replacement rate and a corporate shift from defined pension plans to defined 

contribution plans (e.g. 401 (k) plans). A 2006 behavioral research study discovered that default options in 401 (k) plans had a 

significant impact on savings rates. Standard economic theory suggested that defaults should have little effect on retirement savings, and at the time most U.S. companies had a standard opt-in enrollment—meaning employees had to actively choose to 

participate in the 401 (k) plan. However, the study revealed that participation rates went 

up significantly when a plan switched from opt-in enrollment to opt-out enrollment 

(meaning an individual was automatically enrolled in the 401 (k) plan and had to actively 

choose not to participate). In one company, enrollment went up 35% in the first 3 months after the change and stayed 25 points higher after two years. This important finding led to a widespread change in corporate America, and many companies switched to opt-in retirement savings plans—to the benefit of millions of Americans.

# Retirement Savings 

Tens of millions of Americans are prescribed medication for preventative reasons 

because we know that investing time and money in prevention pays off with better long-

term health and lower costs in the future. Hypertension is generally an asymptomatic 

disease, and patients are given medication to reduce the risk of future problems, such as heart attacks and strokes. However, we also know that people tend to discount future probabilities— and so the extra effort of taking medication today might not seem worth preventing some distant and unknown future problem. For that reason, adherence rates for hypertension treatments are notoriously low. In other words, people often skip or stop taking their medications. 

One tool has proven effective to change this behavior—a medical app that supplies prompts and reminders at the right time. A study showed that the medical app can increase medication adherence by 77%. This type of tool has proven more effective than traditional information campaigns about the importance of medication. The potential positive impact on patient health and long-term medical costs is profound. Today, over 62% of patients now use a digital health platform to manage their health.

# Preventative Medication Examples of Successful Behavior Change in Other Industries 

2023 Knowledge Report | 13 recyclingpartnership.org One successful example is The Partnership’s groundbreaking behavior 

program called “Feet on the Street,” focuses on improving recycling quality. Originally started eight years ago in Massachusetts, the program has since been researched, piloted, scaled, and granted funding in more than 70 communities nationwide. It gives people 

real-time, personalized feedback on the items they place in their recycling carts, so they know what is and is not accepted in their 

community. This program changed behavior — shifted what and how residents were recycling — by intercepting them at the right time with the right message. At the end of the pioneering Massachusetts 

project, the amount of plastic bag contamination dropped from 43% to 15%. The major metropolitan cities of Atlanta and Chicago all saw 

similar successes from the Feet on the Street program. For instance, the educational pilot in Atlanta led to a 27% increase in recyclable materials and a 57% decrease in contamination. Behavior change is possible, and it is needed if we want to improve 

recycling rates across the U.S. However, it will take a focused, collaborative, and synchronized effort from stakeholders across the 

recycling value chain. For this reason, The Partnership launched The Center staffed by both recycling and behavior change experts and was developed with support from authorities and practitioners in the fields of environmental research, behavioral science, community recycling 

program management, and sustainability marketing to ensure that its 

research practices meet the highest scientific standards, while also still being accessible and actionable for local communities. 

Much of The Center’s foundational research is complete, including 

a deep dive ethnography study, comprehensive surveys, and in-field pilots—and the learnings are summarized in this report. This year, The Center will be launching its Recycling Program 

Solutions Hub, an open-access, free digital tool to make data, best 

practices, and resources rapidly available and easily accessible to local and state recycling leaders, including our forthcoming 

Equitable Outreach Guide and Toolkit. The Center’s tools and 

resources will be simple to use,

However, the lack of standardised, quantifiable disassembly potential (DP) assessment methods presents a challenge for the broader adoption of reuse practical applications. Most widely referenced existing DP assessment methods are not applicable in early building-design phases, as they require detailed information typically not available until later design phases. As a result, it is challenging to conduct DP assessment in parallel with life-cycle assessment that must be started early on to ensure that a building’s carbon footprint will not exceed a limit value. The relevance for new quantifiable, holistic methods is highlighted in the existing literature. A novel streamlined method is presented for assessing buildings’ DP based on the quantities of building materials, and their distribution to structures and assemblies. The findings indicate that a material layer-dependent assessment of DP offers advantages over existing methods.
PRACTICE RELEVANCE A more accessible, scalable and reliable DP assessment framework is essential for reducing demolition waste, extending material life-cycles, and cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with future building component production. To maximise GHG reductions, DfD should be considered from the early design phases. The findings indicate that the developed DP assessment method aligns more closely with expert assessment than existing methods, while remaining streamlined. Additionally, three case studies are evaluated to ensure the proposed method’s feasibility and demonstrate its results. By integrating DfD considerations into the early design process, the construction industry can advance towards more circular and resource-efficient practices, ultimately reducing the environmental impact of the built environment.
635 Järvelä et al. Buildings and Cities DOI: 10.5334/bc.556 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND AND CURRENT CHALLENGES Due to its intensive and ever-increasing consumption of raw materials (ECORYS 2014) and energy (IEA 2024), the construction sector has become a critical area for environmental policies in the European Union (EU). With the development of energy efficiency regulations (EU 2024), attention is shifting toward the rapid reduction of product stage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, whole-life GHG assessment of most new buildings will be mandatory in EU member states beginning in 2028, and GHG limits from 2030 onwards (EU 2024).
The interdependency between material use and GHG emissions has been clearly demonstrated (Röck et al. 2020). The focus on urgently needed GHG emission reductions is increasingly directed toward the reduction of product stage emissions, for compelling reasons: the consumption of construction materials is currently growing faster than the global population (Schiavina et al. 2022), which leads to increased GHG emissions (Zhong et al. 2021), despite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) recommendations that construction sector emissions should be reduced by 80–90% by 2050 (IPCC 2022).
Significant environmental benefits associated with the intact disassembly and reuse of existing building products are identified in the literature (Eberhardt et al. 2021; Gallego-Schmid et al. 2020; Material Economics 2018) and should be considered in the early design phase (Graubner & Reiche 2001). Quantitative assessment methods are developed to provide systematic, evidence-based tools for evaluating how well construction projects align with set objectives. For instance, life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely adopted and become part of mainstream building design processes. In contrast, the assessment methods for circularity are in their infancy, yet are being researched intensively.
1.2 CURRENT METHODS FOR ASSESSING DISASSEMBLY POTENTIAL (DP) An overview of the existing assessment methods was conducted through a database search in Scopus, complemented by Google Scholar with search terms ‘disassembly AND assessment AND construction OR buildings’. Key parameters of each method were mapped, including the number of steps, categories of input and data (Table 1).
One set of assessment approaches includes general guidelines, checklists and scoring systems, notably defined in ISO 20887 (2020), which establishes key principles. The EU’s Level(s) framework— developed for assessing and reporting on the sustainability performance of buildings—addresses the assessment of design for disassembly (DfD) potential by categorising the construction process into three stages based on the design phase, and by offering a checklist to facilitate disassembly (EC 2021). These criteria lay the groundwork for conceptual definitions, such as the classification of connection types, but are not designed for quantitative assessment of DP.
Early work by Durmisevic et al. (2003) introduced a methodology for whole-building reversibility assessment. While time-consuming with five steps and 10 criteria, the method’s factors within the disassembly criteria have been adopted in other DP assessment methods. The method by Verberne (2016) refined by van Vliet (2018) assesses the circularity level of building materials through three scales that form the steps: materials, systems and buildings. Cottafava & Ritzen (2021) offer both a full and a simplified method, tested with case studies. The Dutch Green Building Council (DGBC) method, developed by Alba Concepts (van Vliet et al. 2021), continues this development with a streamlined approach, assessing DP based on the connection type, connection accessibility, independency and geometry of the product edge, also considering the environmental impact of products. Recognised as comprehensive, the DGBC method is widely established (Attia et al. 2024; van der Zwaag et al. 2023).
Several authors propose integrating assessment with building information models (BIMs) and LCA methods. Luthin et al. (2023) present an LCA framework incorporating technical and social aspects. Kim & Kim (2023) suggest a method using BIM for automated DfD performance evaluation, combining mathematical evaluation, CO2 emissions and financial aspects. Akinade et al. (2015) develop a BIM-based deconstructability assessment score for evaluating deconstruction 636 Järvelä et al. Buildings and Cities DOI: 10.5334/bc.556 performance during design. A similar method is introduced by Akanbi et al. (2018) for a BIM-based whole-life performance estimator. van der Zwaag (2023) put forth a BIM-integrated method for indicative early design phase and a detailed later stage DP assessment. According to the literature, the assignment of disassembly parameters is difficult, particularly at early design phases. The detailed disassembly parameters are intended to be derived from a data platform. However, it remains unclear how data regarding DGBC method indicators, such as the geometry of the product edge or independency, can be extracted from the database.
1.3 RESEARCH GAPS AND QUESTIONS Although the principles for DfD are mostly similar in the examined literature, numerous differing DP assessment methods have been developed. Unestablished and unstandardised circularity evaluation methods may hinder DP assessment during design (Corona et al. 2019; Rahla et al. 2019). Existing methodologies may not have been sufficiently tested with industry actors (e.g. demolition companies) who possess hands-on building disassembly knowledge (Attia et al. 2024). Although assessment methods exist, a lesser emphasis has been placed on critically examining their applicability for building design practice.
The comparison of steps and amount indicators in the most established line of development shows a trend towards simplification (Table 1). While the literature may not explicitly state the reasons for this shift, it seems likely that the intent is to reduce complexity and labour intensity, thereby enhancing the practicality of DP assessments. While BIM integration offers automation potential, current proposals have remained mostly theoretical. The available data are typically situational, which means that the amount and level of detail in the source, such as the BIM model, varies depending on the design phase and project scope. It is important to note that while advanced BIM-integrated LCA methods offer significant benefits, designers still need to perform a substantial amount of manual work to assess DP effectively.

637 Järvelä et al. Buildings and Cities DOI: 10.5334/bc.556 Various methods have been proposed to assess the circularity of buildings. Some focus on a holistic overall circularity assessment, considering multiple indicators beyond materials, such as adaptability, economic factors and LCA (Luthin et al. 2023). Others specifically evaluate DP (van Vliet et al. 2021). However, there is a lack of DP assessment methods suitable for supporting practical design decisions made during the early design phase.
The aim of this paper is to develop a robust, simple and reliable DP assessment method that connects (1) to the practical design process and (2) can be utilised with BIM data from the early phases to the detailed design phase. The research questions are as follows: • How can a building’s DP be evaluated during the early building design phases with the situationally available data used for LCA?
• How can quantitative values for building component DP be assessed in a sufficiently reliable and practical manner to improve existing LCA calculations, particularly for end-of-life (EoL) scenarios?
2. METHODS AND DATA 2.1 RESEARCH DESIGN The research was conducted within the Finnish context. The research questions were addressed, and a streamlined DP assessment method was developed through two approaches (Figure 1). First, to assess the practicality of existing DP assessment methods, a review of current methodologies was conducted. The applicability of these methods was evaluated by analysing the BIM data and construction drawings of three cases study buildings, focusing on data quality and granularity. A streamlined assessment method was developed that has fewer and clearer parameters. Its practicality was then tested with the three case study buildings.
Simultaneously, a secondary research path was created to evaluate the reliability of DP assessments. A mapping review and categorisation of 263 openly available Finnish structural joint details was conducted, from which a set of 11 representative type joints was selected as the basis for expert interviews. Utilising a two-round Delphi method, 12 experts were interviewed in order to assess the DP of the type joints.
The reliability of second-round expert assessment results was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Each type of joint was evaluated with both the proposed method and the existing DGBC assessment method. To assess the reliability of the proposed method and compare it with the DGBC method, Pearson and Spearman correlations were calculated against Figure 1: Research design: materials, methods and results.
638 Järvelä et al. Buildings and Cities DOI: 10.5334/bc.556 normalised expert interview results. The differences in correlation strength were tested by using three methods for dependent correlations: Steiger’s (1980) z-test, Meng et al.’s (1992) z-test and Zou’s (2007) confidence interval (CI) approach. Additionally, agreement between the methods and expert assessments was evaluated using a Bland & Altman (1986) analysis, which reported mean bias, standard deviation of differences (SD_Diff), CIs for the bias and limits of agreement (LoA). By using normalised interview results, all analyses ensured comparability.
The research design assessed the practicality and applicability of the proposed method within current building design processes, incorporating emerging DfD knowledge from the field.
2.2 FEASIBILITY OF THE DP ASSESSMENT METHODS To evaluate the feasibility of current DP assessment methods (Table 1) within early design-phase Nordic building practices, three representative Finnish case study buildings were chosen (Table 2). The selection criteria included: (1) the availability of BIM data and (2) the diversity of typologies and construction types. While the sample does not encompass all building typologies, it includes three structurally distinct cases, allowing for a diverse validation of a realised building projects’ suitability for DP assessment. The BIMs used in this study reflect the final handover documentation typically produced by Finnish architects and structural engineers, representing the current standard in Finnish building projects.

639 Järvelä et al. Buildings and Cities DOI: 10.5334/bc.556 For all three projects studied, BIM data were insufficient to assess the DP of individual building products, apart from load-bearing steel beams, concrete columns and hollow-core slabs in Väre Module J (VAR) (Table 2). This limitation poses significant challenges for the applicability of all reviewed DP assessment methods (Table 1), which depend on precise product-based data, such as the independence of elements or the geometry of the product edge. Although complementary detail information was generally available through structural engineering drawings, evaluating this information across multiple sources—including element graphs, large-scale BIMs and detailed construction drawings—would require an extensive amount of additional work for DP assessment, even after final project materials have been completed. Furthermore, these documents are typically unavailable during early design phases, when preliminary BIM data are the only available source. Therefore, the provided BIM data pertain to material take-off granularity, necessitating a streamlined method for feasible DP assessment.
2.3 MAPPING AND ANALYSIS OF TYPICAL JOINT DETAILS For a representative selection of typical building structures, a mapping review of openly available Finnish load-bearing structural type connections was concluded using the authors’ university library and modern search engines, with full and partial search terms liitos (in Finnish, joint), periaateliitos (joint principle), vakioliitos (standardised joint), detalji (detail), vakiodetalji (standardised detail), periaatedetalji (detail principle) and mallidetalji (model detail). The review focused on load-bearing concrete, wood and steel connections, given that the primary load-bearing material for 98% of newly constructed Finnish buildings in 2008 was either concrete, wood or steel (Hytönen & Seppänen 2009). The load-bearing structures constitute the largest overground structural cause of product-phase GHG emissions (Häkkinen & Kuittinen 2020), and hence it was decided to focus on them. The territorial scope was limited to the Nordic countries, and the results were supplemented by findings collected by the authors during active architectural practice. A total of

## Abstract

The transition to a circular economy requires products to be designed for recovery, reuse, and remanufacturing. Fastening systems and product architecture play a decisive role in enabling these strategies, yet practical methods for assessing design-for-disassembly (DfD) remain limited, partically at the component level. This paper presents an analytical method that adapts the disassembly mapping approach to evaluate small-scale mechatronic products, focusing on identifying target components for remanufacturing. The method integrates manual disassembly, CAD-based product architecture analysis, and generic life cycle assessment (LCA) data to assess both economic and environmental value. Three LEGO® mechatronic products were analysed as representative cases: the Yellow Hub, the Large Angled Blue Motor, and the Super Mario Figure. Across these cases, key design barriers were identified, including glued battery casings, hidden snap-fits, and soldered electronic clusters. The findings show that economically valuable components often coincide with those having the highest embodied energy and CO2-eq, highlighting the alignment between environmental and economic motivations. The study proposes three design guidelines: (a) minimise disassembly steps to target components, (b) cluster and conserve electrical functionality (*Click-a-tronics*), and (c) standardise fastener systems. Together, these guidelines connect product architecture to circular design strategies and provide actionable insights for manufacturers aiming to integrate remanufacturing into product development and comply with emerging Ecodesign standards.

The sustainability of the construction industry largely depends on effective waste management practices throughout both construction and demolition processes. Construction and demolition waste causes significant environmental degradation, resource depletion, and landfill overflow, making effective waste management an essential component of sustainable construction practices. As the construction industry is one of the biggest contributors of generated waste in today’s world, achieving sustainability in this industry is essential for overall sustainable development. This study aims to examine the sustainable approach to construction and demolition waste and develop strategies for the industry. Based on the evaluation of various waste management techniques, this study used a standard approach in examining existing literature available in renowned research databases and key concepts to develop strategies for future construction and demolition waste management. This included identifying appropriate keywords or combining multiple keywords during the search process. Waste reduction and protecting the planet’s precious natural resources have been the focus of this study. This research investigated strategies during the planning and design phases. Out of the three strategies tested; reduction at the source, recycling, and reuse, source reduction yields the best results. Selecting materials, optimizing designs, and improving processes are all essential techniques for source reduction. Additionally, it explores the role of policy interventions and regulatory frameworks in improving source reduction practices across the industry. However, as waste reduction may not always eliminate waste generation, especially during the demolition of buildings, it is important to supplement this with existing recycling and reuse approaches. With the use of alternative building materials, it is essential to reassess recycling and reuse options for innovative and sustainable construction materials. The findings illustrate that efficient waste reduction regulations, such as green building certifications and mandatory waste management plans, are critical to achieving sustainability. By incorporating source reduction measures in addition to recycling and reuse of waste management, the construction may drastically minimize its environmental effect while increasing cost efficiency and resource usage. This study emphasizes that source reduction should be mandatory for accomplishing sustainable construction and demolition waste management. Recycling and reuse should complement waste reduction efforts.

## 1 Introduction

Infrastructure development is crucial for sustaining a country’s economy. According to multiple studies ([Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018](#ref2)), there is a significant relationship between the construction industry’s growth rate of 3.6 percent (%) and the global economy’s growth rate of 2.5–3% ([Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018](#ref2)). The construction sector has been the subject of much research recently due to its significant energy consumption, environmental emissions, and waste generation ([Singh et al., 2023](#ref91); [Yuan and Shen, 2011](#ref98)). The building materials sector plays a crucial role in large-scale resource exploitation, despite its positive contributions to urbanization worldwide. This aligns with the traditional linear “take-make-dispose” cycle ([Zhang et al., 2020](#ref99)), where resources are extracted from the earth, processed into goods, and then discarded. Once materials have served their purpose, they are disposed of as waste ([Islam et al., 2019](#ref52)). In 2015, the construction industry produced 548 million tons of waste, impacting the environment, according to the EPA’s report. The construction industry heavily relies on natural resources like soil, grout, gasoline, bitumen, lumber, steel, and a host of other petroleum goods. The excessive use of these resources contributes to natural resource depletion. “Waste” refers to materials that have served their purpose but are now either broken or left behind after heavy usage. Through innovation, any unwanted substances can be turned into valuable byproducts, combined materials, or services. These encompass a diverse set of resources, which include building and remodeling debris, electronic waste, electrolysis waste, and municipal substantial refuse. Waste broken or unusable building components, and other garbage generated during a building’s remodeling, demolition, repair, or construction process are collectively known as demolition and building waste. According to [Nandal et al. (2022)](#ref77), the age and kind of construction of the towers being demolished or rebuilt affect the structure of the construction and demolition (C&D) debris. The phrase “C&D waste” is used to describe excess material resulting from various construction, restoration, and demolition tasks, including demolition of the site, land excavation, roadwork, and demolition ([Shen et al., 2004](#ref90)). Anything that ends up in a landfill as a byproduct of building, remodeling, restoring, or destroying is considered C&D waste. Because of their size, weight, and density, these wastes are difficult to transport and store in standard trash cans. Both human and environmental health are negatively affected by the waste products of C&D operations. Worldwide, C&D waste accounts for 20–30% of solid waste, with 70–80% of that coming from concrete and masonry. For environmental sustainability, it is important to handle the massive amounts of C&D waste ([Dean et al., 2016](#ref22)). [Chen et al. (2018)](#ref16) examined managerial areas of C&D waste, highlighting key research trends and challenges. Also 40–50% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions come from the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) field ([Dean et al., 2016](#ref22); [Fetting, 2020](#ref39)). Additionally, buildings consume 40 % of all energy consumed in the European Union (EU) ([Fetting, 2020](#ref39)), with only 5–10% of that energy going into the production of building materials ([Bundgaard et al., 2017](#ref12)). Major construction endeavors, commercial building construction, and housing development programs all contribute to the growing quantity of waste from construction ([Begum et al., 2006](#ref5)). Additionally, 40–50% of the world’s raw material extractions occur in the building industry ([Saghafi and Teshnizi, 2011](#ref87)) or 60% in another study ([Bribian et al., 2011](#ref11)). Worldwide, over 33% is comprised of C&D waste ([Monier et al., 2011](#ref74)). Additionally, worldwide, C&D waste is often dumped in landfills without recycling ([Duan and Li, 2016](#ref28)). As an outcome, C&D waste remains capable of being managed more efficiently. Despite the quantity of published studies on the subject, there is still more work to be done in quantifying the environmental benefits of C&D waste recovery. With the exception of developing nations in South Asia, previous studies on the ecological pros and cons of C&D waste recycling have focused on developed and expanding economies. Based on recent literature reviews, there is a complete lack of work on the attention of C&D recycling in Nepal ([Bovea and Powell, 2016](#ref10)). Many scholars, including [Esa et al. (2017a)](#ref31), [Jimenez-Rivero and Garcia-Navarro (2017)](#ref55), [Cabeza et al. (2014)](#ref14), [Islam et al. (2015)](#ref51), and [Ghisellini et al. (2018)](#ref44) have proposed frameworks for the execution of circular economy (CE) in C&D waste. Furthermore, CE has acquired political significance in the previous decade due to its widespread industrial applications ([Kazancoglu et al., 2021](#ref59)). In comparison with the continuous economy’s focus on the end-of-life scenario, the CE considers the entire lifecycle ([Gedam et al., 2021](#ref42)). It is important to complete the intended management system of waste in order to attain a genuinely CE in buildings ([Low et al., 2020](#ref67)), and these frameworks are criticized for not being able to accomplish their goal in developing economies lacking effective laws and regulations for managing waste from construction ([Ferronato and Torretta, 2019](#ref38)). In emerging economies, there is almost no implementation of CE in construction, despite what appears to be a large amount of research supporting its adoption ([Lockrey et al., 2016](#ref66); [Mahpour, 2018](#ref70)). The stakeholders are concerned about adopting circular practices due to a lack of advice and knowledge about efficient comprehension of C&D waste sorting, reuse, and recycling ([Mahpour, 2018](#ref70); [Charef and Emmitt, 2021](#ref15); [Haselsteiner et al., 2021](#ref47)). Developing and urbanizing regions face the added problem of sustainable waste management. [Doukari et al. (2023)](#ref27) explore the ways in which CE concepts could be applied to urban building information modeling (BIM) in order to improve sustainability and optimize treatment of demolition waste. Post-disaster debris management is another pressing issue, as highlighted by [Esmaeilizadeh et al. (2017)](#ref34), who propose systematic approaches to handle earthquake-induced waste in the ancient City of Ray. [Kabirifar et al. (2021)](#ref58) examine building and demolition waste in large-scale construction enterprises in Australia. They advocate for the use of the system for managing waste to encourage recycling and reduce trash. Problems with public knowledge and inadequate infrastructure are among the issues highlighted by [Esmaeilizadeh et al. (2017)](#ref34) as they pertain to Iran’s municipal garbage disposal. Similarly, the environmental and socioeconomic obstacles that Iran faces when trying to manage its solid waste. One potential answer is the waste-to-energy technology and efficient initiatives to recycle in Malaysia, which are evaluated by [Esmaeilizadeh et al. (2017)](#ref34). Also, according to [Esmaeilizadeh et al. (2017)](#ref34), developing nations should address their own unique waste management challenges by implementing individualized techniques. All things considered, these studies show how important it is to combine technological advancements, government regulations, and community involvement for sustainable garbage management on a worldwide scale. Rubber ([Sukontasukkul and Chaikaew, 2006](#ref92)), slag from electromagnetic arc furnaces ([Faleschini et al., 2015](#ref35)), and fly ash ([Faleschini et al., 2015](#ref35)) are non-standard building materials, while C&D waste recycling is by far the most prevalent. It might lessen the strain on valuable urban space and natural resources while also augmenting the current mineral supply ([Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018](#ref2)). However, the environmental benefits of C&D waste recycling are controversial and very conditional. According to research conducted by [de Magalhaes et al. (2017)](#ref21), Brazil generated 45 million tons of construction waste (CW) in 2015, accounting for 57% of global waste material ([Faleschini et al., 2015](#ref35)). It may supplement the current mineral supply and lessen the strain on precious urban space and natural resources ([Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018](#ref2)). The ecological advantages of C&D waste reusing, however, are highly context-dependent and open to debate. Several countries have utilized life cycle methods to determine the pros and cons of recycling C&D waste. These countries include China ([Ding T. et al., 2016](#ref25)), Brazil ([Rosado et al., 2019](#ref85)), Hong Kong ([Hossain et al., 2016](#ref49)), Spain ([Ortiz et al., 2010](#ref80)), Serbia ([Marinkovic et al., 2010](#ref71)), Italy ([Blengini, 2009](#ref8)), Denmark ([Butera et al., 2015](#ref13)), Finland ([Dahlbo et al., 2015](#ref19)), and Africa ([Vossberg et al., 2014](#ref96)). According to [de Magalhaes et al. (2017)](#ref21), over 45 million tons of construction waste were created in Brazil in 2015, accounting for 57% of the country’s total recyclable waste. Classifying source reduction is crucial for efficient handling construction and demolition waste. By minimizing the items to be handled, examined or discarded, there is a greater chance to limit waste formation at the point of generation. Modular building systems, for example, can reduce waste by using standard sizes and components to minimize offcuts. Additionally, good design planning can prevent over-ordering of resources. Incorporating green building practices, such as using resilient, recyclable, and environmentally conscious materials, can significantly reduce the need for future removal and reconstruction projects, leading to even less waste. Environmentally friendly construction projects can greatly benefit from decisions made during the design phase to control construction waste at its source ([Ekanayake and Ofori, 2004](#ref30); [Esin and Cosgun, 2007](#ref33); [Esa et al., 2017b](#ref32)). Concepts from the CE could offer a long-term solution to the issue of C&D waste. Trash management is evolving with the help of new technologies like block-chain for material passports; and modular construction ([Kazancoglu et al., 2021](#ref59)). For instance, the block-chain system promotes accountability by making it easy to track recycling of materials ([Charef and Emmitt, 2021](#ref15)). [Devaki and Shanmugapriya (2022)](#ref24) reviewed various life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches in C&D waste management, focusing on sustainability and efficiency. Rules and regulations play a significant role in environmentally friendly waste disposal methods. Laws like China’s circular economy; Enhancement Law and the EU’s Waste Guidelines Directive have established global standards. However, additional research is needed to address implementation issues and compliance discrepancies ([Mahpour, 2018](#ref70)). In emerging countries like India and Brazil, C&D waste disposal poses unique challenges due to public ignorance and inadequate infrastructure. Innovative approaches, such as recycling programs organized by municipalities and waste management companies are highlighted in this research ([de Magalhaes et al., 2017](#ref21)). Several worldwide legislative frameworks and directives help shape global construction and demolition (C&D) waste management regulations. The European Union Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) establishes a 70% recycling objective for C&D waste, encouraging circular economy concepts throughout member states ([Moschen-Schimek et al., 2023](#ref75)). Similarly, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), prioritize sustainable waste management techniques to reduce landfill dependency and resource consumption ([Li et al., 2022](#ref65)). In the United States, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Sustainable Materials Management Program promote the reduction and reuse of construction waste, while enforcement varies by state. Meanwhile, China’s Circular Economy Promotion Law (2008) and Technical Code for Building Waste Recycling (2019) have been enacted to increase recycling rates, while implementation is patchy ([Duan et al., 2019](#ref29)). These global legislative guidelines jointly shape national waste laws, directing industry practices toward more sustainable building waste management.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered predictive analytics and robotic sorting systems are revolutionizing the waste management sector ([Li et al., 2022](#ref65)), allowing for more precise garbage sorting and improved recycling efficiency. Despite the importance of technologies like BIM and geographic information systems (GIS) in managing C&D waste efficiently, reducing waste at its source remains the most significant method ([Li et al., 2022](#ref65)). Instead of only addressing the consequences, this strategy gets to the root of the waste. By integrating source reduction techniques into construction project planning and design, environmental effect can be minimized, cost savings can be achieved, resource efficiency can be improved, and more sustainable building practices can be promoted. To maximize the impact of C&D waste management techniques on long-term sustainability and waste reduction, decision-makers should prioritize eliminating waste at its source ([Laurent et al., 2014](#ref64)). This study evaluates various waste management approaches, emphasizing the significant reduction in waste production during the design and planning phases to minimize environmental impact and promote resource conservation. The study also investigates policy interventions and emerging technologies that support waste minimization ([Dahlbo et al., 2015](#ref19)). Furthermore, the report explores global trends and barriers to implementing sustainable waste management systems.

Despite increased global interest in C&D waste management, previous research has mostly concentrated on recycling and reuse options, with little attention paid to source reduction as a proactive approach. Furthermore, while bibliometric studies have examined trends in building waste research, few have combined these findings with a thematic analysis of policy efficacy, new technologies, and implementation challenges, particularly in developing and fast urbanizing locations. There is also a lack of comprehensive understanding of how digital tools like BIM and blockchain can be used to reduce C&D waste at the source. This study fills these gaps by combining rigorous mapping and review methods to assess not only publication trends, but also the legislative, technological, and operational obstacles that influence sustainable waste management.

Given the global issues connected with construction and demolition C&D waste, this study seeks to provide a complete assessment of existing management techniques and new solutions. Specifically, it aims to discover worldwide trends, thematic themes, and knowledge clusters relevant to C&D waste using bibliometric and literature analysis. The study also assesses the role of source reduction as a key approach for waste reduction, in comparison to more extensively used methods such as recycling and reuse. It also investigates the effectiveness of international regulatory frameworks and policy interventions in promoting sustainable practices in the building industry. The study also investigates the potential of emerging technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve waste monitoring, material efficiency, and the implementation of circular economy concepts. Finally, it identifies crucial research gaps and makes recommendations for improving the implementation of sustainable C&D waste solutions, particularly in developing countries where enforcement and infrastructure are

INTRODUCTION Sustainable architectural materials can be traced back to traditional practices utilizing locally available resources. The modern sustainability movement, however, gained momentum in the late 20th century, with green building certifications like LEED promoting the use of sustainable materials (Komurlu, & Ozengul, 2020). Today, advances in material science and environmental awareness drive the development and application of these materials (Liu et al., 2022). The integration of sustainable materials into modern architectural design has emerged as a critical focus in recent years, largely in response to escalating environmental concerns and the finite nature of global resources. The construction industry, traditionally characterized by its substantial consumption of raw materials and its significant contribution to environmental degradation, has increasingly become the focal point of sustainability efforts (Lima et al., 2021). As the sector responsible for nearly 11% of global energy-related carbon emissions, the construction industry faces mounting pressure to adopt practices that mitigate its environmental impact (Maier D., 2021). Sustainable architecture represents a proactive approach to addressing these challenges by emphasizing the use of materials that not only reduce the environmental footprint of buildings but also enhance their overall performance. Their recyclability, energy efficiency, and minimal ecological impact throughout their life cycle typically characterizes these materials. For instance, the adoption of materials like reclaimed wood, recycled steel, and low-VOC (volatile organic compound) finishes can significantly reduce the harmful emissions and waste associated with conventional construction processes (Chayaamor-Heil et al., 2023). Figure 1. The global CO2 emissions by sector Figure 2. Buildings – Breakthrough Agenda Report 2023 Georgette Kilgore, (2022) Breakthrough Agenda Report (2023) International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS) ISSN: 2643-640X Vol. 8 Issue 9 September - 2024, Pages: 36-54 www.ijeais.org/ijeais 37 Recent studies highlight various innovative approaches and materials that are shaping the future of sustainable architecture. For instance, the use of natural and bio-based materials, such as raw wood and mycelium composites, offers promising solutions for creating structures that can seamlessly return to the natural material cycle without extensive processing (Ali et al., 2023). Additionally, the application of nanotechnology and smart materials in building design enhances energy efficiency and occupant comfort, further contributing to sustainability goals (Rybak-Niedziółka et al.,2023). The role of recycled and locally sourced materials is also emphasized in contemporary architectural practices. These materials not only reduce the environmental impact but also support the creation of harmonious and energy-efficient structures (Žujović et al., 2022). Moreover, the integration of digital fabrication technologies allows for precise control over material properties and life cycles, enabling the development of innovative building spaces with new architectural typologies (Liu et al.,2022). Lightweight and minimal mass structures are another area of focus, with research exploring new materials and design tools to enhance the sustainability of membrane constructions and textile architecture (Hu et al.,2020). These advancements demonstrate the potential for creating efficient and environmentally friendly buildings that align with the principles of the green economy. Moreover, the push towards sustainable materials is not merely a reaction to environmental pressures but also a reflection of broader socio-economic trends. As awareness of climate change intensifies and regulatory frameworks become more stringent, architects and builders are increasingly recognizing the economic and social benefits of sustainable design. This includes not only the potential for cost savings through energy efficiency but also the enhancement of occupant health and well-being, as well as the alignment with corporate social responsibility goals (Li et al., 2020). The significance of reviewing recent trends and innovations in sustainable materials lies in the potential of these materials to redefine modern architectural practices. As architects and designers strive to balance aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability, the choice of materials plays a crucial role in achieving these objectives (Salehi et al.,2021). This review contributes to the discourse by providing a comprehensive analysis of how sustainable materials are influencing architectural design, from aesthetic considerations to performance outcomes. Moreover, it highlights the role of innovation in overcoming the challenges associated with the adoption of these materials, thereby offering valuable insights for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. 2. OVERVIEW OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS IN ARCHITECTURE 2.1 Definition and Classification Sustainable materials are defined as those that exert minimal environmental impact throughout their entire lifecycle, encompassing the stages of raw material extraction, production, usage, and eventual disposal (Nazari et al., 2020). These materials are essential in the pursuit of environmentally responsible construction, as they contribute to reducing the overall ecological footprint of buildings. Key characteristics of sustainable materials include renewability, low embodied energy, recyclability, and the ability to enhance a building's energy efficiency (Adier et al., 2011). Renewability refers to the capacity of a material to be replenished naturally within a short timeframe relative to human consumption rates. Examples include bamboo, which is one of the fastest-growing plants, and cork, harvested from the bark of cork oak trees without harming the tree itself (Minunno et al., 2021). Low embodied energy is another critical characteristic, signifying the reduced amount of energy required to produce and transport the material. For instance, materials like recycled steel and engineered wood are favored for their significantly lower energy demands compared to traditional steel or concrete (Awogbemi et al., 2022). Recyclability plays a pivotal role in minimizing waste and conserving resources, as materials that can be reclaimed and reused contribute to a circular economy, thereby reducing the need for virgin raw materials. Recycled materials, such as reclaimed wood, which is salvaged from old structures, and recycled metals, which are repurposed from scrap, are prominent examples (Nasr et al., 2023). Furthermore, enhancement of building energy efficiency through the use of sustainable materials can lead to significant reductions in operational energy use. For example, insulating materials made from natural fibers, like sheep wool or cellulose, not only provide thermal resistance but also help in regulating indoor humidity, thereby improving overall energy efficiency (Paul et al., 2023). Sustainable materials can be broadly classified into three main categories: natural materials, recycled materials, and low-emission materials. Natural materials include those derived directly from renewable resources with minimal processing, such as bamboo and cork. These materials are not only sustainable in their sourcing but also contribute to the aesthetic and biophilic aspects of design, promoting a connection with nature (Rybak-Niedziółka et al.,2023). Recycled materials involve the use of previously used materials that have been processed for reuse, such as reclaimed wood and recycled metal. The use of recycled materials reduces the demand for new raw materials and lowers the carbon footprint associated with material production (Maung et al.,2022). International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS) ISSN: 2643-640X Vol. 8 Issue 9 September - 2024, Pages: 36-54 www.ijeais.org/ijeais 38 Lastly, low-emission materials are those that emit fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other pollutants during production, installation, and use. For example, low-VOC paints and green concrete, which incorporates industrial byproducts like fly ash, not only reduce harmful emissions but also contribute to healthier indoor environments (Ha et al., 2020). Table 1. Classification and Characteristics of Sustainable Materials Category Examples Key Characteristics Environmental Impact Natural Materials Bamboo, Cork Renewable, Biodegradable, Low Processing Requirements Reduces reliance on non-renewable resources; Promotes biophilic design Recycled Materials Reclaimed Wood, Recycled Metal Recyclable, Low Embodied Energy, Resource Conservation Reduces waste and demand for new raw materials; Lowers carbon footprint Low-Emission Materials Low-VOC Paints, Green Concrete Low VOCs, Incorporates Industrial Byproducts, Improves Indoor Air Quality Minimizes harmful emissions; Reduces environmental pollutants Figure 3. Lifecycle of Sustainable Materials (Huang et al., 2020). 3. RECENT TRENDS IN SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS 3.1. Bioinspired, Bio based, and Living Materials Recent research has advanced the categorization of bio-based materials into three distinct types: bio-inspired materials, bio-based materials, and living materials. These classifications represent a spectrum of innovation in the realm of sustainable materials, each offering unique properties that contribute to their potential use in modern architectural design. Bio-inspired materials are engineered to replicate the structures, processes, and functions observed in nature. By mimicking the efficiency and resilience found in natural organisms, these materials often exhibit superior durability, self-healing properties, and energy efficiency (Naveen et al., 2021). For instance, Bio-inspired materials such as nacre-mimetic composites draw inspiration from the layered structure of seashells, resulting in materials that are lightweight yet exceptionally tough (Reichert et al.,2020). These materials hold great promise for architectural applications, particularly in the creation of lightweight, resilient building components that can withstand extreme environmental conditions. Bio-based materials are derived directly from biological sources such as plants, animals, or microbes. These materials are typically renewable, biodegradable, and have a lower environmental impact compared to conventional synthetic materials (Chan et al., 2021). Common examples include International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS) ISSN: 2643-640X Vol. 8 Issue 9 September - 2024, Pages: 36-54 www.ijeais.org/ijeais 39 bioplastics made from cornstarch or cellulose, and insulation materials derived from agricultural byproducts like straw or hemp (Justo-Reinoso et al., 2023). The use of bio-based materials in architecture not only contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of buildings but also supports the circular economy by enabling the use of waste products as raw materials. Living materials represent the most innovative and dynamic category of bio-based materials. These materials are capable of self-repair, adaptation, and even growth, much like living organisms. Living materials, such as mycelium-based composites or bio-concrete containing bacteria that can precipitate calcium carbonate to heal cracks, push the boundaries of traditional building materials (Chayaamor-Heil et al., 2023). The integration of living materials into architectural design could revolutionize how buildings interact with their environment, potentially leading to structures that can adapt to changing conditions or self-heal after damage. Despite the exciting potential of bio-inspired, bio-based, and living materials, significant challenges remain, particularly in scaling these innovations for large architectural projects. While theoretical advancements in laboratory settings have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of these materials, translating these findings into practical applications presents several obstacles. One of the primary challenges is the difficulty in producing these materials at a scale and cost that is viable for commercial construction (Pradhan et al., 2020). Additionally, there are technical hurdles related to the integration of these materials into existing construction practices, including issues of material consistency, long-term durability, and regulatory approval (Rodríguez et al., 2020). 3.2 The Cyclical Nature of Bio-based Materials At the core of the eco-metabolistic design framework is the emphasis on the cyclical nature of bio-based materials. These materials, derived from renewable biological sources such as plants, fungi, and algae, possess inherent properties that allow them to be naturally replenished and degraded over time. This cyclical characteristic aligns with the principles of sustainability, promoting a closed-loop system where materials are continually reused, recycled, or returned to the environment in a benign form (Lima et al., 2021). By leveraging these properties, architects can design structures that not only minimize environmental impact but also enhance the regenerative capacity of ecosystems. Figure 4. Not all bio-based materials are biodegradable (Robin Conrad ,2020). 3.3 Bacterial Cellulose in Bio-digital Architecture Bacterial cellulose is increasingly recognized as a pivotal material in the advancement of bio digital architecture, a field that integrates biological processes with digital design technologies. Its emergence as a promising material is largely attributed to the simplicity and accessibility of its production. Unlike many traditional building materials, bacterial cellulose can be synthesized through relatively straightforward, domestically applicable procedures. This ease of production not only facilitates its widespread use but also aligns with the principles of sustainable architecture by reducing the reliance on resource-intensive industrial processes (Wang et al., 2019). One of the primary advantages of bacterial cellulose is its renewability. Derived from microbial processes, bacterial cellulose is a biocompatible and biodegradable material, making it a sustainable alternative to conventional construction materials. Its production process, which typically involves the cultivation of specific bacterial strains in nutrient-rich media, allows for continuous regeneration, thereby supporting the development of a circular economy in architectural practices (Pandit & Kumar ,2021). Moreover, bacterial cellulose exhibits remarkable durability, a key property that enhances its applicability in various structural contexts. This durability, combined with the International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS) ISSN: 2643-640X Vol. 8 Issue 9 September - 2024, Pages: 36-54 www.ijeais.org/ijeais 40 material's high tensile strength and flexibility, makes it suitable for a wide range of architectural applications, from load-bearing components to flexible, adaptive structures (Chibrikov et al., 2023). Furthermore, bacterial cellulose offers significant potential for structural customization. Its unique molecular structure allows for precise control over its physical properties during the production process. By manipulating factors such as the composition of the growth medium and environmental conditions, researchers can tailor the mechanical properties of bacterial cellulose to meet specific architectural requirements (Huang et al., 2014). This capacity for customization is particularly advantageous in bio digital architecture, where the integration of biological materials with digital fabrication techniques necessitates materials that can be engineered to exact specifications. Ongoing research is focused on enhancing the mechanical properties of bacterial cellulose to expand its applicability in architectural design. Innovations in genetic engineering and material science are being explored to increase its strength, elasticity, and resistance to environmental stressors. These advancements aim to establish bacterial cellulose as a versatile and reliable material for a wide array of architectural elements, from façade panels to interior components (Paul et al., 2023). To effectively communicate the potential of bacterial cellulose in bio digital architecture, visual aids are essential. A figure depicting the production process from bacterial cultivation and cellulose synthesis to its application in construction would provide a comprehensive overview of its life cycle and sustainability benefits. Additionally, a table comparing the mechanical and environmental properties of bacterial cellulose with traditional building materials, such as concrete and steel, would offer a clear, quantitative assessment of its advantages and areas for further research. 3.4 Wood-Based Nanotechnologies Wood-based materials, particularly those enhanced through nanotechnologies, are increasingly recognized for their sustainability and versatility in a broad range of applications. The integration of nanotechnology into wood-based materials has opened new avenues for their use, extending beyond traditional construction to advanced technological applications, such as energy storage, wastewater treatment, and even biomedicine (Bi et al., 2021). This expansion is driven by the unique hierarchical structure and mechanical properties of wood, which make it an ideal candidate for sustainable material design. The sustainability of wood-based materials lies in their renewable nature, as wood is a naturally occurring resource that can be harvested in a sustainable manner. When enhanced with nanotechnology, the inherent properties of wood, such as its strength, durability, and thermal stability, can be significantly improved, leading to materials that are not only eco-friendly but also perform better than their conventional counterparts (Devi et al., 2021). For instance, the incorporation of cellulose nanofibers can increase the tensile strength of wood composites, making them suitable for high-performance structural applications. Additionally, the modification of wood at the nanoscale can enhance its resistance to moisture and biological degradation, further extending its lifespan and reducing maintenance costs. In advanced technological applications, wood-based materials have shown great potential. In energy storage, for example, wood-derived nanomaterials are being explored for use in supercapacitors and batteries due to their high surface area and conductive properties (Hamad & Idrus 2022). Similarly, in wastewater treatment, modified wood materials can serve as effective adsorbents for removing contaminants from water, leveraging their porous structure and surface chemistry (Kumar et al., 2021). These applications demonstrate the versatility of wood when combined with nanotechnology, offering sustainable solutions to some of the most pressing environmental challenges. The hierarchical structure of wood, characterized by its multi-scale organization from the macro to the nanoscale, is a key factor in its suitability for sustainable material design. This structure not only contributes to its mechanical strength but also provides a template for the development of advanced materials with tailored properties (Puppi, & Chiellini ,2020). By manipulating the structure at different scales, researchers can design wood-based materials with specific functionalities, such as enhanced thermal insulation or improved load-bearing capacity, making them competitive alternatives to synthetic materials in various industries.

Highlight the various structural components, such as cellulose fibers and lignin, and how they contribute to the overall mechanical properties of wood (Chen & Hu, 2020) 3.5 Bio-based Polyesters Bio-based polyesters have emerged as a significant area of progress in the field of sustainable materials science, offering a promising alternative to conventional, petroleum-based polymers. These materials are derived from renewable biological resources and are characterized by their tunable properties, which make them suitable for

[Alan Naditz](https://www.greenbuildermedia.com/blog/author/alan-naditz) 

36 min read

## From ‘new and improved’ to ‘cutting edge,’ these highlighted sustainable products are a grab bag of green.

At one time, everything we now buy, use or own was new and groundbreaking. Most of these items have been upgraded many times. Green Builder’s “Sustainable Products of the Year” lineup for 2024 includes some of these classic fixtures. But there are also eye-popping innovations making their debut.   
Our 2024 roster manufactures items that encourage sustainability through innovative technology and vision. For returnees, reappearing on our list reinforces their enviro-friendly actions. For newcomers, it’s a chance for their products to become tomorrow’s classics.

### Appliances

No natural gas used, a definite energy savings and green construction make [Whirlpool’s KitchenAid 4-Element Induction Slide-In Convection Range](http://www.kitchenaid.com/) a sustainable product. Ease of use makes the 6.4-cubic-foot, 30-inch model an eye catching one for consumers.

Billed as “a sophisticated blend of precision and versatility,” the 4-Element Induction Slide-In Convection Range features a sensor-induction cooktop that directs heat precisely within cookware. Regular electric cooktops lose heat as it travels from the element through the surface of the cooktop. However, sensor induction results in little-to-no heat loss from the surface of the appliance to a serving platter. Induction cooktops also offer exceptional responsiveness to temperature changes, and a homeowner does not need to wait for the coil to cool when lowering the heat setting. A user may quickly go from a rolling boil to a gentle simmer.

Using 60 percent less energy with every load, the [2024 All-In-One WashCombo from LG Electronics](http://www.lg.com/) can wash and dry clothing in under two hours with help from the Inverter Heat Pump technology, without having to alternate the load. With LG’s advanced inverter heat pump incorporated into the ventless electric dryer, it specializes in low-temperature drying without damage to fabric, and it can be installed virtually anywhere with a standard 120-volt plug.

The ENERGY STAR-certified WashCombo also saves water. It has built-in sensors with AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size. It automatically selects the right wash motions and temperatures, dispenses detergent and softener, and selects the drying motions level for more-advanced fabric care. The super-large 5.0-cubic-foot capacity means fewer loads, further conserving energy and water.   
LG’s washer-dryers also pair with the TWINWash feature, the SideKick mini-washer that is ideal for cleaning delicates or daily workout gear without the need for additional space. And, the WashCombo is compatible with the ThinQ app, which enables updates, downloadable features, diagnostic alerts and maintenance via an owner’s smartphone.

When appliance shopping, homeowners are increasingly taking environmental aspects as well as aesthetics into consideration. Bertazzoni’s latest Professional Series range is a very big step—the company’s biggest thus far—into the benefits of induction cooking.

---

[Bertazzoni’s 48-inch induction range](https://us.bertazzoni.com/) delivers functionality, design and easy cleanup while conserving energy and preserving indoor air quality. The unit features one continuous cooking surface—the largest the company has ever offered—with six high-power heating zones with a maximum power output of 3,700 watts. The right-side heating zones can be bridged to create a larger cooking area. Each induction area has a convenient read-out interface on the glass worktop. The range also features a dedicated air-frying mode for healthier cooking, digital-timed cooking functions and sensor-controlled cookware detection.

Meanwhile, the unit’s 4.6-cubic-foot oven is designed to maximize interior volume and can be wiped clean without effort. A 2.4-cubic-foot auxiliary oven is perfect for smaller dishes and for warming. Both ovens include features such as smooth telescopic glides for shelves and soft-close doors. And, the range’s new extra dark Carbonio finish provides a seamless blend from the hood to the kitchen surface.

### Bath and Lighting

[DMF Lighting’s](http://www.dmflighting.com/) collection of modular 2-inch downlights feature field-changeable trims, modules and optics for exceptional versatility, performance, installation, serviceability and sustainability. The downlights are free of toxins and harmful chemicals deemed non-sustainable. The energy-efficient LED downlights are also ENERGY STAR rated and only consume 9.5 watts to 16.5 watts, depending on desired brightness.

Drivers are integrated into the light engine modules versus the housing for easy serviceability. Because housing can be reused, there is no need to rip out the ceiling when wanting to change optics and trims, or when LED chips are upgraded as technology continues to advance.

Meanwhile, in a breakthrough for error-free installation, the downlights are shipped with a patent-pending collar to eliminate over-cutting and drywall repair, which is common with small-aperture fixtures. The collar provides depth adjustment and a secure fit, making flush-to-ceiling installation in drywall or millwork easy to achieve. It also provides overspray protection.

Housings and modules can ship separately so the housings can be installed before the lighting design is finalized, reducing onsite storage requirements and helping an installer maintain a tight project deadline.

### Construction

With cement becoming a huge environmental problem—experts estimate that producing 1 kilogram (kg) of concrete also means sending 1 kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere—Fortera developed the ReCarb process, a groundbreaking method to manufacture low-carbon cement within the existing production infrastructure. ReCarb generates cement with 70 percent less CO2 from its proprietary chemistry. When combined with green energy, cement becomes zero CO2 emission, and when combined with green energy and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)  techniques, CO2 emissions prevention surpasses 100 percent, meaning it actually absorbs carbon from the atmosphere.   
This transformative bolt-on technology seamlessly integrates with current cement facilities, leveraging the entire production framework, from machinery to feedstocks, to ensure a globally scalable solution for sustainable cement manufacturing.

The ReCarb process results in [ReAct, a green cement](https://forteraglobal.com/products) that meets regulatory standards and can be blended with or used in place of traditional cement. It can be blended into ASTM C150, C595, or C1157-ASTM C150. Industry applications include Portland Limestone Cement, Slag Extender, Fly Ash Extender, PLC Extender, LC3 Enabled, Fiber-Cement Board and Lightweight Aggregate.

[Preflex Inc.’s Preflex Building System](http://www.preflexinc.com/) harnesses the power of building information modeling (BIM) and offsite fabrication to engineer and manufacture structural insulated panels (SIPs). The SIPs include a solid core of expanded polystyrene (EPS) structurally laminated between two oriented strand board (OSB) skins, resulting in superior energy efficiency, unmatched comfort, exceptional air quality, flexible design, robust structural strength, and a construction process that is twice as fast compared to traditional stick framing.

The system also dramatically reduces environmental impacts and jobsite waste, and all manufacturing waste is recycled. Preflex structures emit 45 percent less CO2 annually than traditional stick frame buildings, significantly contributing to a greener planet. The airtight construction eliminates contaminants such as dust and pollen coming into the building, prevents mold growth, and reduces noise pollution. A Preflex SIP home uses 40-60 percent less energy than its stick frame counterpart.

The Preflex SIPs’ resilience against natural disasters result in stronger homes that can lead to lower insurance costs, and their superior energy performance often results in higher appraisal values.

[Fortress Building Products’ Evolution steel deck framing system](https://fortressbp.com/framing/evolution-framing) leverages the proven advantages of steel. This comprehensive system is manufactured with mild carbon steel, which is formed into light-gauge steel (LGC) components. The recyclable building material has a yield strength roughly 10 times greater than wood, and flexes with force. And, steel framing should last at least 50 years, long beyond treated wood, which needs to be stained and sealed every few years and replaced every two decades.

Steel is also noncombustible, which means that it can help builders and contractors complete fire-safe projects in regions that are prone to wildfires, or densely populated urban areas where fires can spread rapidly.

The material’s capacity for load-bearing weight has a direct correlation with its ability to provide greater spans. For example, fewer posts are required, which frees up more usable space underneath a customer’s upper-level deck. Contractors are not handcuffed by the span limitations of wood joists, allowing for greater design flexibility with design. They can also conserve resources and support a more-sustainable project.

GMX Group/Novawood North America’s [Thermowood Ayous lumber](http://www.thermowood.com) combines the elegance of premium wood aesthetics with cutting-edge thermal modification technology. Harvested from fast-growing Ayous trees, this premium lumber ensures minimal environmental impact. It allows architects and designers to elevate projects with quality, durability and the sophisticated look of Ayous wood.

Crucial for ceiling, wall and rainscreen applications, the lumber’s thermal modification process significantly reduces moisture content, making Thermowood Ayous a lightweight material with exceptional adaptability and minimal need for maintenance. The thermally modified lumber is up to 300 percent drier than standard wood species, allowing easy handling, simplified installation and reduction of labor. The process also increases the wood’s resistance to decay, insects and moisture.

Thermowood has a smaller ecological footprint compared to concrete and steel. Concrete and steel production requires 3 to 4 times more water and almost twice as many fossil fuels, exacerbating environmental strain. While growing, wood captures carbon dioxide and stores it, effectively reducing atmospheric carbon levels. And, aiding in controlling noise levels within interiors, Ayous offers natural acoustic properties that contribute to sound absorption to create more comfortable indoor environments.

Relevant Content: The Bide, an architectural Dorset cabin, is a labour of love of a pair of design enthusiasts – one an architect, of London-based studio LAMA, and the other working for Nordic design brand Åben. Built almost entirely by hand during pandemic lockdowns, this charming getaway was designed for its creators, as a private retreat, which can also be used on occasion as a rental. Handling the design, product sourcing and construction together, the couple ensured that their project employed principles of sustainable architecture, such as using local materials and eco-friendly building techniques. For example, The Bide is designed using the WikiHouse system, with a wooden frame cut by CNC and bolted together by hand. Low-carbon materials used include sheep’s wool and wood fibre insulation. There is [...] When we met outdoor furniture manufacturer Vestre’s then-CEO (and current Minister of Trade and Industry of Norway) Jan Christian Vestre about a year ago, he enthusiastically took us through his plans to create The Plus, ’the world’s most sustainable factory’. Now, thanks to his efforts and with a design courtesy of Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the building site in the middle of a Norwegian forest we visited in 2021 is now a fully-fledged production facility – and so much more. The Plus opens this week in Norway’s Magnor, inviting employees, clients and visitors to experience its sustainable architecture. ‘The Plus is a factory for the people! It is a project we have put an enormous amount of soul and energy into.

[Sustainable architecture](https://www.wallpaper.com/tag/sustainable-architecture) is a complicated, multi-layered task - and in 2025, it is more important than ever. Architects need to consider materials, construction, performance and provenance of everything, as well as maintenance and afterlife - social [sustainability](https://www.wallpaper.com/tag/sustainability) is critical too. With climate change and social challenges now in live development across the globe, it is not news that the green agenda should be at the top of everyone's mind. It is something we have flagged extensively in our recent Wallpaper* [Design Awards](https://www.wallpaper.com/tag/wallpaper-design-awards)'s [2025 architecture gongs](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/2025-wallpaper-architecture-awards) too, highlighting works that restore, rebalance and renew as nature, wellbeing and sustainability take centre stage across the board.

![Image 5: Urban sequoia model by SOM](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NNhXK2QNwpQygCWrxVSiJB.jpg)

Many architects have developed innovative ways to reduce the industry's carbon debt, both in construction and during a building’s lifetime, through [sustainable architecture](https://www.wallpaper.com/tag/sustainable-architecture). One of the industry’s giants, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), has unveiled a model for carbon-negative architecture – meet the ‘[Urban Sequoia](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/cop26-reveals-urban-sequoia-model-som-sustainable-architecture)’.

Luckily, there are some great projects to discover, which provide inspiration and help spearhead change. This is sustainable architecture at its best: the finest examples from across the globe, from amazing abodes to centres of care and hard-working offices. Scroll down, for the lowdown on sustainability's key principles, as well as case studies of buildings that not only look good but also do good.

Key sustainability principles in architecture
---------------------------------------------

[](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/sustainable-architecture-innovation)
Sustainable architecture: a building's life
-------------------------------------------

[](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/sustainable-architecture-innovation)
Buildings have long lives - encompassing a past, present and future - and enhancing their sustainability credentials can be reflected in every step of their journey. Sustainably-minded architects ensure projects are constructed in a way that doesn't burden their environment - be it through the use of locally sourced material that doesn't travel miles and miles to reach the site, or through building methods that have minimal impact on their surroundings (from prefabrication to new-era concrete, such as Seratch's carbon-neutral composite cement, which won the [2022 Obel Prize](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/seratech-sustainable-cement-wins-obel-award-2022)), respecting the existing context, natural and otherwise.

Once erected, making sure a project does its bit to support sustainable maintenance, energy consumption throughout its operational life, and fostering wellness (by minimizing exposure risks for its users to harmful substances, for example), is another important tick on the green building list. Smart ventilation, Passivhaus principles, and the use of natural materials can be equally beneficial to consider.

![Image 6: Kempegowda International Airport by SOM interior with hanging lamps](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MmGRQkg4vADzbUfn3DGRuj.jpg)

[Kempegowda International Airport](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/kempegowda-international-airport-terminal-two-som-bengaluru-india) recently unveiled its new Terminal 2 structure, a pioneering design using green technologies and bamboo by architecture studio SOM with interiors by Enter Projects Asia. Located in Bengaluru (BLR Airport), southern India, this significant piece of transport infrastructure services one of the country's largest cities – as well as its wider region. It is all conceived to uphold Bengaluru's reputation as the 'garden city'.

Finally, architecture's afterlife can also substantially add to a project's claim to eco-friendliness. Many sustainable architecture examples are designed to be demountable and reusable - conceived with the inherent ability to be either completely moved and rebuilt elsewhere as needed, expanding their lifespan, or by recycling individual materials and components, helping, this way, the structure has a second life.

A long life is also important. The construction industry is responsible for a sizable chunk of the world's carbon emissions, so once a building is up and out in the world, the best thing is to make sure it lives a long, healthy life. It can be designed to serve its purpose for some time; or it can be designed to be retrofitted and reimagined with ease in the future, as its users' needs change. Overall, thinking about how to best expand a building's life can play a key role in making it more sustainable.

![Image 7: view of the interior towards terrace at Apartamento Paraiso by Ruina](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMo3xskYHQcEoUwDTornjF.jpg)

Apartamento Paraíso is Brazilian studio [Rúina](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/ruina-profile-architecture-brazil)'s renovation of a first-floor apartment in the Edifício Olga Ferreira building in São Paulo. A previously fragmented space was transformed into a bright, open home brimming with expertly recycled and repurposed material touches.

Sustainable architecture's social side
--------------------------------------

We would be remiss to ignore architecture's social side in the green building discussion. Ultimately, a building is created to serve a function - and its users. So, thinking smart about making the most of a piece of architecture so that it supports local communities and enhances the lives of its inhabitants and guests is paramount to ensuring a building is future-proofed for a long life.

By blending accessibility and inclusivity gestures into the design thinking, architecture can cater to as many of its users as possible. Meanwhile, taking into consideration that users' lives change too - ageing and a variety of needs can affect the way we all use a building - is paramount in making sure structures of all typologies are efficient and functional for as long as possible.

![Image 8: March House is a sustainable, future-proof home by the River Thames](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c7nsiGSHpNcnaSbR2XsVRV.jpg)

If it is the clean, modernist shapes of Knox Bhavan’s new [March House](https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/march-house-knox-bhavan-uk) that first signal it as an exceptional contemporary home, then its strong eco-credentials and idyllic countryside location are sure to cement its position as a gentle but also truly forward-thinking piece of residential architecture. The project, recently completed on a natural floodplain on the banks of the River Thames in the UK, is a cleverly prefabricated, flood- and future-proof home.

  ### Adaptive Reuse

  Adaptive reuse was (for very good reasons) one of this year's buzzwords. From incentivizing feasible office conversions on a federal level to considering the future potential of high-rise parking areas as urban farms within the municipal realm, our news editorial was buzzing with future strategies as well as successful executions of the mantra this year. [...] In Switzerland, meanwhile, researchers from Empa's Building Energy Materials and Components Lab made progress toward carbon-storing building insulation made from plant-based materials, while ETH Zurich's Digital Building Technologies group 3D printed lightweight insulation foam using recycled industrial waste materials.

  Yale University's new Yale Center for Ecosystems + Architecture collaborated with the UN Environment Programme on a report that called for further decarbonization efforts in the construction sector.

  In May, we published a mass timber nature observatory in a forest near Barcelona designed and constructed by a team of students and researchers from the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia's Masters in Advanced Ecological Buildings and Biocities program.

  Wrapping up a year in the wake of the recently concluded [COP28](https://archinect.com/news/tag/2234099/cop28) UN climate summit that resulted in, well, [*mild* levels of agreement](https://archinect.com/news/article/150407967/cop28-deal-agreed-amid-controversy-over-phasing-out-of-fossil-fuels) on the role of fossil fuels, it is possible to sense a slightly increased urgency toward this most pressing planetary issue on a high-minded diplomatic level. As we're quickly approaching the quarter mark of the 21st century, however, much more concrete action and innovation in various sectors of the AEC domain is needed — and is already happening — on the ground level as well, as we have seen in our reporting on Archinect.

  Continuing with our [2023 Year in Review](https://archinect.com/news/tag/2392753/2023-year-in-review) series, let's take a look back at some of the story highlights focusing on decarbonization efforts, material research, policy implementation, and successful applications of sustainability principles this year.

  ### Building Electrification

  The process of gradually phasing out fossil fuels in new construction and decarbonizing the building sector made further strides, with [New York State](https://archinect.com/news/article/150348324/new-york-state-set-to-ban-natural-gas-appliances-in-new-buildings) leaders agreeing to do away with natural gas appliances in most new buildings in the coming years, [Boston](https://archinect.com/news/article/150359412/boston-has-officially-banned-fossil-fuels-in-all-new-city-owned-buildings) requiring the electrification in government-owned buildings, and [Washington State](https://archinect.com/news/article/150404215/washington-state-effectively-bans-fossil-fueled-appliances-in-new-construction) also effectively blocking fossil-fueled appliances in new construction with the declared goal of eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

  Energy-efficient [heat pump technology](https://archinect.com/news/article/150338134/a-heat-pump-revolution-could-bring-much-needed-building-decarbonization), meanwhile, continued to enjoy rapid adoption, as data from the AIA's [By The Numbers](https://archinect.com/news/article/150378529/large-increase-in-all-electric-and-net-zero-energy-projects-among-aia-2030-commitment-signatories-report-says) report suggested in September.

  ### Adaptive Reuse

  Adaptive reuse was (for very good reasons) one of this year's buzzwords. From incentivizing feasible office conversions on a [federal level](https://archinect.com/news/article/150391812/white-house-announces-new-guidebook-to-funding-office-conversions-nationwide) to considering the future potential of [high-rise parking areas as urban farms](https://archinect.com/news/article/150360401/melbourne-considers-the-future-potential-of-high-rise-parking-areas-as-urban-farms) within the municipal realm, our news editorial was buzzing with future strategies as well as successful executions of the mantra this year.

  Popular examples were the ambitious, PAU-designed [The Refinery at Domino office conversion](https://archinect.com/news/article/150377987/pau-designed-the-refinery-at-domino-reopens-brooklyn-s-most-iconic-building-to-the-modern-workplace) at the former Domino Sugar Factory site in Brooklyn; the transformation of an [abandoned Detroit book depository](https://archinect.com/news/article/150348030/gensler-and-civilian-team-reimagines-abandoned-detroit-book-depository-as-startup-hub-for-mobility-innovation) as a startup hub for mobility innovation by a team including Gensler and CIVILIAN; MVRDV's redesign of an aging skyscraper from the 1990s as the new vibrant [Shenzhen Women & Children’s Centre](https://archinect.com/news/article/150383653/mvrdv-transforms-1990s-shenzhen-tower-into-vibrant-and-colorful-skyscraper); or the redevelopment project of Harvard Law School’s Lewis International Law Center led by [TenBerke](https://archinect.com/firms/cover/1466/deborah-berke-partners).

  3XN, whose massive [Quay Quarter Tower 'upcycling' conversion](https://archinect.com/news/article/150330696/3xn-completes-world-s-largest-upcycled-tower-in-sydney) of a 1970s tower in Sydney, Australia, won the [CTBUH Best Tall Building Worldwide](https://archinect.com/news/bustler/9542/3xn-s-upcycled-quay-quarter-tower-is-the-ctbuh-best-tall-building-worldwide-of-2023) and the [World Building of the Year](https://archinect.com/news/bustler/9022/3xn-s-upcycled-quay-quarter-tower-is-the-2022-world-building-of-the-year) award, was also distinguished with Fast Company’s [Most Innovative Companies 2023](https://archinect.com/news/article/150341149/upcycled-skyscraper-earns-3xn-a-spot-on-fast-company-s-world-s-most-innovative-companies-list) title this year.

  ### Passive House

  Successful implementations of [passive house](https://archinect.com/news/tag/28520/passive-house) strategies on various scales also made a few headlines this year: In October, we reported that Boston's new Handel Architects-designed [Winthrop Center](https://archinect.com/news/article/150382264/boston-s-new-winthrop-center-is-now-officially-the-largest-passive-house-office-building-in-the-world) had been certified by the Passive House Institute as the largest Passive House office design in the world.

  On a single-family scale, we published a handsome [retrofit of a 1970s garage](https://archinect.com/news/article/150387135/atelier-l-abri-completes-passive-house-retrofit-of-1970s-garage-in-rural-quebec) in rural Quebec by Montreal-based Atelier L’Abri and the [refurbishment of a traditional Edwardian terrace house](https://archinect.com/news/article/150339422/an-edwardian-terrace-house-refurbished-as-a-sleek-energy-saving-abode-in-london) in the British capital into a highly energy-efficient abode led by the firm Architecture for London.

  ### Policy

  The policy sector — traditionally a sluggish apparatus to finally come up to speed — introduced a number of legislative and regulatory measures to combat carbon emissions in the built environment.

  In June, the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for [significant changes to the cement industry](https://archinect.com/news/article/150353717/un-secretary-general-calls-for-significant-changes-to-the-cement-industry-ahead-of-2050) by demanding accelerated decarbonization efforts, followed by a $90 million commitment to [building code upgrades](https://archinect.com/news/article/150357881/biden-announces-90-million-commitment-to-upgrade-building-codes-nationwide) by the Biden Administration in order to increase energy efficiency, resiliency, and overall performance of American buildings.

  On the state level, California made history in August by becoming the first U.S. state to [mandate embodied carbon reduction measures](https://archinect.com/news/article/150359542/california-becomes-first-u-s-state-to-mandate-embodied-carbon-reduction-measures) in addition to efforts to [amend building codes to facilitate adaptive reuse](https://archinect.com/news/article/150355576/california-is-amending-building-codes-to-facilitate-adaptive-reuse). New York state was busy, too, introducing a ""first-in-the-nation"" [mandate for concrete emissions](https://archinect.com/news/article/150377588/new-york-to-introduce-first-in-the-nation-mandate-for-concrete-emissions) in September, while New York City launched a 40,000-unit [adaptive reuse office conversion plan](https://archinect.com/news/article/150335606/new-york-city-announces-new-40-000-unit-adaptive-reuse-office-conversion-plan) and a [new mass timber construction grant program](https://archinect.com/news/article/150381548/nyc-rolls-out-new-mass-timber-construction-grant-program) this year.

  The American Institute of Architects, meanwhile, reminded us in August that nearly [$20 billion in grant funding](https://archinect.com/news/article/150358759/aia-announces-20-billion-in-grant-funding-made-available-for-adaptive-reuse-and-decarbonization-projects), allocated by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund under the Inflation Reduction Act, had been made available by the Environmental Protection Agency for adaptive reuse and decarbonization projects.

  ### Software & AI

  Novel sustainability software solutions and approaches were popular in our news reporting as well.

  In February, Architecture 2030 presented the new [CARE (Carbon Avoided Retrofit Estimator) Tool](https://archinect.com/news/article/150339295/architecture-2030-s-new-care-tool-helps-measure-the-carbon-reduction-of-retrofit-projects), which offers assistance in measuring the carbon reduction of reuse projects.

  A deep learning model is the driving force behind a new AI tool, trained by researchers from the University of Cambridge's Department of Architecture, that seeks to support architects with [""hard-to-decarbonize"" (HtD) home retrofitting projects](https://archinect.com/news/article/150393820/cambridge-researchers-develop-ai-model-to-help-retrofit-and-decarbonize-housing).

  In May, Henning Larsen offered a glimpse into the firm's [seven-step computational design process](https://archinect.com/news/article/150348530/henning-larsen-details-computational-design-process-behind-mass-timber-world-of-volvo-center), using the Kangaroo and Galapagos plugins on Grasshopper, that helped create the geometrically complex and currently under-construction World of Volvo mass timber center in Gothenburg, Sweden.

  ### Material Research & Academia

  Architecture and engineering schools also planted their flags at the forefront of decarbonization efforts within the educational sector.

  The University of Toronto’s School of Engineering announced plans for a new [Centre for the Sustainable Built Environment](https://archinect.com/news/article/150336231/the-university-of-toronto-announces-new-centre-for-the-sustainable-built-environment-backed-by-key-industry-leaders) at the beginning of the year while also showing off their research into [multilayered optofluidics window systems](https://archinect.com/news/article/150342832/university-of-toronto-researchers-develop-a-fluid-based-light-filtering-technology-to-help-with-heating-cooling-and-lighting-in-buildings) that could assist with heating, cooling, and lighting in future buildings.

  Researchers from MIT published their [open-source concept for a cooling chamber](https://archinect.com/news/article/150358269/mit-team-tests-open-source-cooling-chamber-using-75-less-energy-than-refrigerated-cold-rooms) that promises to use 75% less energy than conventional refrigerated cold rooms, and also announced further findings from their research of using baking soda to help [concrete projects reduce their carbon footprint](https://archinect.com/news/article/150345793/baking-soda-may-help-concrete-absorb-carbon-mit-researchers-find).

  Focusing on the building envelope, University of Chicago researchers discovered a new [""chameleon-like"" material](https://archinect.com/news/article/150338476/university-of-chicago-researchers-develop-chameleon-like-material-that-can-regulate-buildings-by-changing-from-solid-to-liquid) with the potential to reduce the need for mechanical HVAC systems, while a team at the University of Maryland developed a [""cooling glass"" coating](https://archinect.com/news/article/150399544/university-of-maryland-researchers-develop-cooling-glass-that-can-redirect-a-building-s-heat-into-space) that can redirect building heat into space by reflecting up to 99% of solar radiation.

  In Switzerland, meanwhile, researchers from Empa's Building Energy Materials and Components Lab made progress toward [carbon-storing building insulation made from plant-based materials](https://archinect.com/news/article/150339015/swiss-researchers-have-developed-a-carbon-storing-building-insulation-made-from-plant-based-materials), while ETH Zurich's Digital Building Technologies group [3D printed lightweight insulation foam](https://archinect.com/news/article/150404346/eth-zurich-researcher-develops-3d-printed-insulation-foam-using-recycled-materials) using recycled industrial waste materials.

  Yale University's new Yale Center for Ecosystems + Architecture collaborated with the UN Environment Programme on a [report that called for further decarbonization efforts](https://archinect.com/news/article/150372005/further-action-on-decarbonization-in-the-construction-sector-is-needed-urges-un-yale-study) in the construction sector.

  In May, we published a [mass timber nature observatory](https://archinect.com/news/article/150349898/iaac-team-s-mass-timber-nature-observatory-floats-above-a-barcelona-forest) in a forest near Barcelona designed and constructed by a team of students and researchers from the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia's Masters in Advanced Ecological Buildings and Biocities program.

  ### Mass Timber

  Mass timber continued to make our news headlines this year — with innovative completed buildings laying the groundwork for more to come, as well as plenty of future project announcements leading to greater acceptance of the carbon-capturing building method.

  Canada and forest-rich northern U.S. regions led the way with newly-completed structures, such as TenBerke's [hybrid‑CLT residential hall](https://archinect.com/news/article/150399270/tenberke-completes-hybrid-clt-residential-hall-design-at-brown-university) at Brown University; the [A-Building Expansion](https://archinect.com/news/article/150374663/dialog-and-smoke-architecture-complete-ontario-college-building-inspired-by-indigenous-principles) at Centennial College by DIALOG and Smoke Architecture; the HGA-designed [Barry Mills Hall and Gibbons Center for Arctic Studies](https://archinect.com/news/article/150407909/hga-leverages-maine-s-working-forest-identity-for-a-pair-of-mass-timber-structures-at-bowdoin-college) at Bowdoin College in Maine; the new [Health Sciences Education Building](https://archinect.com/news/article/150384211/a-textural-and-reflective-building-skin-wraps-the-university-of-washington-s-new-health-sciences-education-building) at the University of Washington by The Miller Hull Partnership, The S/L/A/M Collaborative, and Lease Crutcher Lewis; or the 70-foot [mass timber pedestrian bridge](https://archinect.com/news/article/150348052/mass-timber-pedestrian-bridge-rises-at-toronto-s-george-brown-college) at Toronto's new Limberlost Place building for George Brown College, designed by Moriyama and Teshima Architects and Acton Ostry Architects.

  Outside of North America, we covered the Toyo Ito-designed [""Gaia"" Business School building](https://archinect.com/news/article/150350782/toyo-ito-completes-work-on-the-largest-mass-timber-building-in-asia) for Singapore's Nanyang Technological University (reportedly now the largest mass timber building in Asia), as well as a 15-unit [social housing development](https://archinect.com/news/article/150333869/pietriarchitectes-designs-15-unit-social-housing-project-using-cross-laminated-timber) by PietriArchitectes using cross-laminated timber in France.

Sustainable and Eco-friendly Designs
------------------------------------

Sustainable and eco-friendly designs prioritize environmental responsibility and resource efficiency in architecture. These designs intentionally minimize negative impacts on the planet while also promoting healthier indoor environments and community resilience. As climate change urgency grows, sustainable design becomes essential for a greener future, so let’s review some of the top ways we’re seeing this in architecture.

### Integration of Eco-friendly Materials

Innovative architects are increasingly incorporating eco-friendly materials into their designs. This includes recycled steel, reclaimed wood, bamboo, cork, and recycled plastics. By prioritizing these eco-friendly materials, architects not only reduce resource depletion but also mitigate pollution and waste generation throughout the construction process.

### Implementation of Energy-efficient Technologies

The use of energy-efficient technology lies at the heart of sustainable architecture. From passive design strategies like orientation and natural ventilation to advanced systems such as solar panels, geothermal heating, and smart building automation, architects use a variety of technologies to minimize energy consumption and reliance on fossil fuels. Together, this ultimately reduces carbon emissions and operational costs for building owners.

### Embracing Green Building Practices

Green building practices, including LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification and biophilic design principles, are increasingly embraced by architects committed to sustainability. These practices prioritize strategies like optimizing site usage, preserving natural habitats, and promoting occupant well-being through access to daylight, views of nature, and indoor air quality enhancements, fostering environments that nurture both people and the planet.

### Examples of Sustainable Architectural Projects

To help you get a feel for how architects are making their designs more sustainable and eco-friendly, we’ll go over some examples.

The Edge in Amsterdam, renowned as the world’s most sustainable office building, incorporates innovative features such as solar panels, energy-efficient LED lighting, and a smart system that adjusts climate and lighting based on occupancy.

The Bullitt Center in Seattle is all about sustainability, meeting its energy needs entirely from renewable sources. This building also uses composting toilets and rainwater harvesting.

Both of these projects demonstrate that sustainable architecture is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible reality that is shaping the future of our surroundings.

![Image 17: Mithradham, a fully renewable energy powered educational institution in India](https://www.format.com/wp-content/uploads/Mithradham-a-fully-renewable-energy-powered-educational-institution-in-India-1024x769.jpg)
Adaptive Reuse and Renovation
-----------------------------

Adaptive reuse and renovation redefine architectural practices by transforming existing structures into vibrant, sustainable spaces. With this approach, architects can breathe new life into old buildings, ensuring that they preserve important heritage details while also meeting modern needs. This also helps to reduce waste and environmental impact, bringing together past and present in the best possible way. Here are some of the ways in which architects are accomplishing this:

### Emphasizing the Importance of Adaptive Reuse

With sustainability becoming more and more popular, the importance of adaptive reuse for architects continues to grow. With limited space and resources, repurposing existing structures offers a sustainable solution to meet changing needs while preserving cultural heritage. Architects tasked with adaptive reuse projects are challenged to reimagine spaces, blending history with modern functionality.

### Repurposing Existing Structures for Sustainability

You’ve likely seen this idea in action in your own neighborhood. With this idea, architects renovate old buildings to minimize environmental impact, preserve resources, and foster community revitalization. This approach reduces waste and energy consumption while honoring cultural heritage.

### Preserving Cultural and Historical Significance

As we’ve mentioned, when considering renovating historical sites, architects aren’t simply tearing down buildings and designing new modern ones. Instead, the preservation of the cultural and historical significance of the building is heavily considered before any changes are made. In fact, the preservation of cultural and historical significance is a fundamental aspect of architectural practice.

Architects identify, document, and conserve structures that hold cultural and historical significance. They do this through meticulous research, sensitive restoration, and adaptive reuse, which helps to maintain the authenticity and integrity of these sites while also allowing for their continued use and enjoyment by communities.

### Notable Examples of Successful Adaptive Reuse Projects

The High Line in New York City stands as a prime example of a successful adaptive reuse project. In this scenario, an abandoned elevated railway was transformed into a vibrant public park, seamlessly blending nature with urban infrastructure.

Another remarkable project is the Tate Modern in London, once a disused power station, now a world-renowned museum of contemporary art, showcasing the harmonious integration of industrial heritage with cultural revitalization.

Closer to nature, the Eden Project in Cornwall repurposed an abandoned china clay pit into a sprawling botanical garden and educational center, demonstrating how architecture can coexist harmoniously with the environment.

These projects not only breathe new life into forgotten spaces but also serve as inspiring models for sustainable urban renewal and community engagement.

Smart and Responsive Architecture
---------------------------------

Smart and responsive architecture revolutionizes building design by integrating cutting-edge technologies to optimize comfort, efficiency, and sustainability. It entails structures that dynamically adapt to changing conditions and user preferences in real time, promising a future where buildings become intuitive and deeply attuned to their surroundings and occupants. Let’s dig a bit deeper into some of the ways that architects are using smart and responsive architecture:

### Integration of Smart Technologies in Design

The integration of smart technologies in design represents a significant evolution in architecture, where buildings become more than static structures, but rather dynamic entities. By incorporating sensors, data analytics, and automation systems, architects can create spaces that intelligently adapt to environmental conditions, user behavior, and energy demands.

Together, these technologies enhance comfort, efficiency, and sustainability, which not only improves the overall functionality of buildings but also fosters a more interactive and personalized experience for occupants.

### Responsive Buildings Adapting to Environmental Conditions

Responsive buildings adapting to environmental conditions help show off the relationship between architecture and nature, where structures seamlessly interact with their surroundings to optimize performance and sustainability. Through innovative design strategies such as passive solar heating, natural ventilation systems, and dynamic shading elements, architects create buildings that respond intuitively to changing weather patterns, daylight levels, and air quality.

These responsive features not only enhance occupant comfort but also reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. By harmonizing with the natural environment, these buildings exemplify a holistic approach to architecture.

### Utilization of Automated Climate Control and Security Systems

The utilization of automated climate control and security systems represents a pinnacle of modern architectural innovation, enhancing both comfort and safety within buildings. Through sophisticated sensors and algorithms, architects can design buildings that intelligently regulate temperature, humidity, and air quality. Additionally, automated security systems provide real-time monitoring and response to potential threats, bolstering safety and peace of mind.

By integrating these technologies seamlessly into building design, architects not only elevate the user experience but also contribute to greater efficiency, sustainability, and resilience within the building itself.

### Examples Showcasing the Marriage of Technology and Architecture

Biophilic Design
----------------

Biophilic design integrates nature into architecture to enhance well-being and sustainability. By incorporating elements like natural light and greenery, it fosters calm, productivity, and environmental connection. This approach creates healthier, more harmonious spaces that benefit both occupants and the planet. Let’s check out some of the key components of biophilic design:

### Definition and Significance of Biophilic Design

Biophilic design represents a holistic approach to architecture and urban planning, acknowledging the profound psychological and physiological benefits of connecting people with nature. It emphasizes the integration of natural elements, patterns, and processes into architectural spaces to improve human well-being and enhance the overall quality of life.

By fostering a sense of harmony and connection with the natural world, biophilic design seeks to counteract the negative effects of urbanization, such as stress, anxiety, and alienation, while promoting health, productivity, and creativity.

### Incorporation of Nature Into the Built Environment

The incorporation of nature into the built environment encompasses a wide range of design strategies and techniques aimed at simulating or evoking natural experiences within architectural spaces. This may include maximizing access to natural light through large windows and skylights, integrating indoor greenery such as living walls and potted plants, incorporating water features like fountains or ponds, and utilizing natural materials such as wood, stone, and earth-based finishes. Additionally, biophilic design often incorporates biomorphic shapes and patterns inspired by nature, such as fractal geometries and organic forms.

### Benefits of Biophilic Design for Well-being

Research into the effects of biophilic design on human well-being has consistently shown positive outcomes. Exposure to natural elements in architecture has been linked to reduced stress levels, improved mood and cognitive function, enhanced creativity and productivity, and increased overall satisfaction with indoor","## Principles of Sustainable Design in Consumer Electronics

**Designing consumer electronics with sustainability in mind requires a focus on energy efficiency, recyclability, and ease of disassembly to minimize environmental impact.** These principles not only reduce waste but also support a circular economy by enabling component reuse and material recovery.

### Energy-Efficient Components
Energy efficiency is a cornerstone of sustainable design. Modern devices increasingly incorporate advanced power management systems and energy-efficient components. For example, the use of GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology in power adapters, such as those by Power Integrations, reduces energy loss during conversion, achieving up to 94% efficiency. Additionally, smart energy management systems in devices, like adaptive brightness in displays or low-power standby modes, significantly lower energy consumption. Metrics such as Energy Star certification ensure compliance with stringent energy efficiency standards.

### Recyclability
Recyclability is critical to reducing the environmental footprint of electronics. Materials like aluminum and recycled plastics are increasingly used in device casings. For instance, Apple’s MacBook Air (2023) features a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure. Advanced recycling technologies, such as chemical recycling, break down polymers into monomers, enabling the production of high-quality recycled plastics. Pyrolysis, a process highlighted in recent innovations, converts non-recyclable plastics into usable fuels or new materials, further enhancing recycling rates.

### Design for Disassembly
Design for disassembly (DfD) ensures that products can be easily taken apart for repair, recycling, or reuse. This principle is exemplified by modular smartphones like the Fairphone 4, which allows users to replace components such as batteries and screens without specialized tools. Key DfD strategies include:
- **Standardized Fasteners:** Using uniform screws and connectors simplifies disassembly.
- **Modular Design:** Components are designed as independent units, reducing complexity.
- **Material Labeling:** Clear labeling of materials aids in sorting and recycling.

A notable case study is the Taisei Corporation’s deconstruction of the Grand Prince Hotel Akasaka in Tokyo. By employing modular assemblies and reversible connections, the project achieved 85% material recovery and reduced carbon emissions by 85%.

### Impact on Waste and Carbon Reduction
Adopting these principles has measurable environmental benefits. For example, modular designs reduce e-waste by extending product lifespans through repairability. According to the Journal of Circular Economy (2025), DfD practices can lower lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 30% compared to traditional designs. Furthermore, energy-efficient devices reduce operational carbon footprints, contributing to global decarbonization goals.

 15 August 2024 

Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has revolutionized the manufacturing industry by offering unprecedented design freedom, material efficiency, and customization capabilities. Over the past few decades, significant advancements in additive manufacturing technologies have transformed the landscape of production, moving from prototyping to full-scale manufacturing in various sectors such as aerospace, healthcare, automotive, and consumer goods.

These innovations have not only enhanced the quality and complexity of products but have also enabled more sustainable and cost-effective production processes. As additive manufacturing continues to evolve, its potential to disrupt traditional manufacturing methods and contribute to the development of new products and materials is becoming increasingly apparent.

## **1. IndyCar’s 3D Printed Top Frame Increases Driver Safety**

Earlier this year saw the news that [IndyCar was going to be implementing additive manufacturing](https://www.indycar.com/) to increase safety measures in its vehicles. IndyCar is the “Indianapolis-based governing body for North America’s premier open-wheel auto racing series, the NTT INDYCAR SERIES.”

[In an article for Additive Manufacturing magazine](https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/articles/indycars-3d-printed-top-frame-increases-driver-safety), the company explained how additive manufacturing had been used to develop certain features of the car and crucially, ensure their safety. To take one example, “The additively manufactured top frame is one such built-in feature. In addition to holding the car’s aeroscreen in place to protect the driver from debris, it can potentially save a driver’s life in the extreme case of a rollover.”

IndyCar chose to use additive manufacturing as the process “enables a variety of unique shapes and wall thicknesses that are available much more readily than traditional forms of manufacturing, especially factoring in the tight time limit the IndyCar team was working with.”

As we see further growth in the automotive industry, it will be worth keeping an eye on how additive manufacturing plays a role.

## **2. Spherene Creates Metamaterial with Geometry Derived from Spheres**

If complex geometries are in your sphere of interest then you’ll be delighted to hear that spherene’s [first release candidate became available](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spherene_food4rhino-webinar-spherene-metamaterial-activity-7190643812719833092-R7HW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) via Rhino in May.

[Spherene is the company behind the metamaterial of the same name.](https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/articles/spherene-creates-metamaterials-with-geometry-derived-from-spheres) According to the company, a spherene is “a groundbreaking and patented metamaterial. It embodies a new class of minimal surface, the Adaptive Density Minimal Surface (ADMS), marking a pivotal innovation in our field.”

In an interview with Additive Manufacturing magazine, Spherene outlines the advantages of the metamaterial. “Their shape translates to isotropic strength throughout the part volume, and they are self-supporting to manufacture with most 3D printing technologies. According to the company, the surface conformity and controllable envelope condition also enable seamless assembly integration with these structures.”

These developments mark a bold step forward in the world of AM metamaterials and we would recommend exploring Spherene’s work further (although sufferers of typophobia must do so at their own discretion).

## **3. How Machining Makes AM Successful for Innovative 3D Manufacturing**

[AMFG is inspired by both the possibilities](https://amfg.ai/2024/06/18/long-read-has-hybrid-machining-lived-up-to-its-promise/) of additive manufacturing and more traditional production processes such as CNC machining. 

Earlier this year, Peter Zelinski [sat down with US-based additive manufacturer Innovative 3D Manufacturing](https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/articles/how-machining-makes-am-successful-for-innovative-3d-manufacturing) to learn about the role that CNC plays in their production processes. The company has a unique approach to their builds, routinely overspecifying part features. While this may be surprising, the reasons behind it are fairly simple. 

“Even additive parts that are heavy with extra stock still are nearer to net shape than many comparable castings, with less machining work than a casting might require — meaning the extra stock guards the part’s value without imposing significant extra cost or effort downstream.”

This story is a great example of how hybrid manufacturing offers the best of both worlds, with additive manufacturing offering a part that’s closer to the net shape than cast parts with CNC machining providing the finishing touches.

Critics of hybrid manufacturing have pointed to the fact that these methods have yet to become mainstream, it will be interesting to see how AM and machining processes used in tandem become common in the future.

## **4. All Design Labs and Protolabs’s 3D Printed Tennis Racket Collaboration**

If you were in Paris this summer you might have witnessed some truly gripping sporting moments. [You may have even visited the Musée du Luxembourg and seen the Match exhibition which](https://www.additivemanufacturing.media/articles/3d-printed-tennis-racket-serves-a-collaborative-win-), “explores the role of design in the progress of sport and the ties forged between these two fields, as well as potential developments.”

As a part of this exhibition, US-based industrial design company, All Design Lab teamed up with Protolabs to produce a 3D-printed aluminium tennis racket prototype: Hìtëkw.

According to All Design Lab, “Advancements in technology have led to improved equipment that is lighter and more durable, aiding athletes in their performance. This pursuit of performance is especially true in tennis, where rackets have become lighter and more robust due to new materials and manufacturing techniques.

However, there’s still room to explore a racket that leverages new technology to depart from conventional designs and further improve the sport. This is where Hìtëkw comes into play.”

The company goes on to describe how its “tree-like structure that connects the handle to the head, setting it apart from any other racket. Inspired by generative design, Hìtëkw seeks to redefine what a tennis racket can be.”

## **5. Oerlikon Unveils Breakthrough Additive Manufacturing Solutions for Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing**

As any tech buff knows, [semiconductors are all around us from smartphones and digital cameras to televisions](https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/global/en/knowledge/semiconductor/room/about/life.html#:~:text=Many%20digital%20consumer%20products%20in,LED%20bulbs%20also%20use%20semiconductors.), washing machines and refrigerators. 

2024 saw Swiss additive manufacturer, [Oerlikon make major strides in additive manufacturing’s role in producing these components](https://www.oerlikon.com/am/en/about-us/media/semiconductor-equipment-manufacturing/).

According to the company, “One of the standout advantages of Oerlikon AM is the improved thermal management of critical components, such as pedestals or chucks. This enhancement leads to greater equipment accuracy, faster processing speeds, and increased overall lifecycle value. Additionally, Oerlikon’s AM technology is optimizing fluid flow within complex manifolds, further elevating equipment performance.”

According to Dan Haller, Head of Commercial, Additive Manufacturing, “Oerlikon’s pioneering AM solutions represent a game-changing advancement for the semiconductor industry,” “We’re setting new standards for efficiency, precision, and innovation, and we’re excited to bring these innovations to the semiconductor market.”

## **6. RAPID + TCT Returned to the West Coast**

Industry leaders, unmissable events, groundbreaking technology – these are just a few things that you might have caught if you were lucky enough to attend [RAPID + TCT](https://www.rapid3devent.com/event/2024-recap/). 

RAPID + TCT is North America’s Largest AM and industrial 3D printing event and boasted almost 10,000 attendees at the Los Angeles Convention Center. According to the organisers, “Speakers, exhibitors, and attendees enjoyed a dynamic three-day program, which showcased more groundbreaking ideas, advancements, and opportunities for collaboration and discovery than ever before.”

The recap goes on to explain how the industry had its sights set on the future of additive manufacturing including the need to collaborate and consolidate. “While panellists agreed on AM’s potential, many cautioned against overhyping the technology at the risk of eroding trust and credibility in the broader manufacturing sector. Instead, they said, companies should direct their attention toward problems only AM can solve.”

If you missed it this year, don’t worry, RAPID + TCT returns in April at Huntington Place in Detroit for more of a look into the cutting edge of additive manufacturing.

## **7. Nikon Corp. Opens California Technology Center to Provide Customer Support**

Our recent articles have discussed how Nikon is making partnerships to advance the development of additive manufacturing, for example through [its investment in Hybrid Technologies Global](https://www.nikon.com/company/news/2022/0914_01.html).  

[Last month saw Nikon unveil a new Technology Centre in Long Beach, California](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B7m35SbCoMY9Q6EwzUSeo5rESUYcHHO7). According to Nikon, “This cutting-edge, 90,000-square-foot facility marks the next critical step in the Nikon Vision 2030 plan, aiming to revolutionize manufacturing and establish digital manufacturing (DM) as a growth pillar for Nikon. Strategically located to serve aviation, aerospace, and defense clients, the facility is already operational, setting new benchmarks in advanced manufacturing.”

These services are designed to meet critical customer needs for adoption, scaling, and supply chain capacity.”

We’re looking forward to seeing what new innovations come from the centre.

## **8. Hitachi Rail Uses Roboze’s Pioneering Technology to Manufacture Spare Parts**

In the railway industry, the availability and cost of spare part production has been a major issue. [Hitachi Rail’s partnership with ROBOZE aims to address this and keep railway systems on track](https://www.roboze.com/pressFiles/hitachi-rail-chooses-roboze-for-its-pioneering-additive-technology-for-railway-spare-parts-menu-2_1721985068.pdf).

According to ROBOZE, “The solution enables Hitachi Rail to implement industrial 3D printing technology, using materials such as ULTEM™ 9085 and Carbon PEEK for the production of spare parts for its trains.”

ROBOZE goes on to explain how their “additive manufacturing technology […] enables faster and more cost-effective production compared to traditional machining methods. With the implementation of the ARGO 500 solution, Hitachi Rail can now replace traditionally machined metal parts, significantly reducing costs and delivery times.”

## **9. Health-threat ‘forever chemicals’ removed from water with 3D-printed ceramic ink**

We know that additive manufacturing can be a game changer when it comes to the medical industry. To take one example, 3D printing O&P devices allows clinicians to provide their patients with tailored care efficiently and cost-effectively. But can additive manufacturing improve our drinking water?

[According to researchers at the University of Bath, the answer is yes.](https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/health-threat-forever-chemicals-removed-from-water-with-3d-printed-ceramic-ink/)

In July of 2024, the University announced that “Engineers have invented a new way to remove health-harming ‘forever chemicals’ from water – using 3D printing.”

These forever chemicals in question are perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) which can take over 1,000 years to break down. PFAS have the potential to cause us real harm, having been linked to issues with reproduction and cardiovascular health as well as increasing the risk of diabetes.

This new technology works using “ink infused with the ceramic indium oxide, the 4cm monoliths are created by extruding the ink from a 3D printer – like squeezing toothpaste from a tube – and forming it into a lattice shape. Because indium oxide bonds with PFAS, the chemicals immediately stick to the monoliths and can be removed from the water in under three hours, which is compatible with current water treatment plants in the UK and abroad.”

The results have been promising with the monoliths removing up to 75% of PFAS from water. 

As this technology develops, we may soon raise a glass to additive manufacturing as it works to make our drinking water safer and healthier.

## **Conclusion**

The world of additive manufacturing continues to push boundaries and redefine what’s possible across a range of industries. From enhancing safety in motorsports to innovating sports equipment, and even revolutionizing semiconductor manufacturing, 3D printing is proving to be more than just a tool—it’s a game-changer. 

As we look to the future, it’s clear that the blend of traditional techniques with cutting-edge technologies will drive the next wave of innovation, making once-impossible ideas a tangible reality. With so much potential on the horizon, it’s an exciting time to be part of the additive manufacturing journey. Here’s to seeing where this ever-evolving technology takes us next!

## Abstract

The use of recycled polymers in additive manufacturing (AM), a. k.a. three-dimensional printing (3DP), has gained recognition recently due to its potential to minimize plastic waste and support sustainable manufacturing practices. Recycled polymers offer numerous benefits and potential uses in 3DP, making them an attractive option for sustainable production and waste management practices. Reinforcements can enhance the properties of recycled polymers, allowing for the production of complex objects with diverse properties. Optimizing printing parameters is crucial for understanding the specific needs of each material to enhance recycling outcomes and preserve material integrity. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on 3DP using recycled polymers, chemical and mechanical recycling methods, and the effects of reinforcements, multiple recycling cycles, and printing parameters on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed objects. Despite progress, research gaps remain regarding economic feasibility, environmental impact, and long-term durability. Filling these gaps could unlock the full potential of 3DP with recycled polymers and support the transition towards a circular economy.

1. Introduction
---------------

3D printing has emerged as a viable alternative to conventional manufacturing for making prototypes, complex geometries and manufacturing products in a diverse range of industries such as aerospace, medical and automotive sectors.[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S2753812525000990#cit1) AM uses computer-aided design (CAD) drawings for designing an object. A slicing program is then used to slice the object, generating a G-code which contains information related to geometry that has to be traced. The 3D printer reads the G-code and melts, fuses or deposits (depending on the process) the material layer upon layer to form the object.[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S2753812525000990#cit2) The various types of 3D printing processes as per ASTM 52900 along with their advantages/disadvantages and applications are illustrated in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S2753812525000990#tab1). 3D printing is quite innovative in the sense that it enhances the manufacturing process and creates opportunities for fabricating intricate shapes and designs. While AM has revolutionized prototype design and ready to use part production, it also plays a pivotal role in the advancement of Industry 4.0 and has the potential to align with sustainable development goals. Aligning AM practices with sustainable development goals is essential for fostering long-term ecological balance and responsible industrial growth.

# Traditional Printing, Sustainable Printing, and the Environment: What You Need to Know

Every day, businesses around the world rely on printing to get things done. However, have you ever stopped to consider the environmental cost of all those printed pages? From energy consumption to paper waste, traditional printing practices contribute significantly to carbon footprints.

It’s not all bad news, though—by making a few adjustments, companies can switch to sustainable printing practices that help reduce their environmental impact. Let’s dive into how traditional printing stacks up against more eco-friendly alternatives.

## The Environmental Toll of Traditional Printing

Before we discuss the solutions, it’s important to understand the environmental costs associated with traditional printing practices. Here are the three major ways that conventional printing impacts the environment:

### Energy Use and Carbon Footprint

[Traditional printers](https://sosny.com/print-services/equipment-and-leasing/production-printers/) and [copiers](https://sosny.com/print-services/equipment-and-leasing/office-copiers-mfps/) consume a significant amount of energy. Every time a page is printed, energy is required to run the machine, and the more machines a business uses, the more electricity is consumed. In many areas, this electricity is generated from fossil fuels, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and increases a company’s carbon footprint. This adds up quickly if your office has multiple printers running all day.

### Paper Production and Waste

Did you know that paper production is one of the biggest contributors to deforestation? Manufacturing paper requires cutting down trees and using a lot of water and energy. Not to mention, once paper is used for printing, it often ends up in the trash or landfill. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), paper accounts for about 25% of landfill waste in the U.S. So, businesses that frequently print documents contribute to the destruction of forests and the growing waste problem.

### Ink and Chemical Waste

Traditional printing involves ink, which can be harmful to the environment if disposed of improperly. Conventional ink contains chemicals and solvents that can contaminate soil and water if not disposed of properly. The ink cartridges themselves, if not recycled, add to the burden of plastic waste in landfills.

## Why Sustainable Printing Practices Matter

Now that we understand the impact of traditional printing, let’s take a closer look at why shifting to eco-friendly printing practices is so important.

### Reducing Waste and Resource Consumption

Sustainable printing practices aim to use fewer resources—namely paper, energy, and ink—while minimizing the amount of waste produced. Switching to eco-friendly alternatives reduces the burden on landfills, conserves forests, and decreases overall resource consumption.

### Cost Savings for Your Business

In addition to benefiting the environment, sustainable printing practices also lead to cost savings for your business. By printing less, using energy-efficient machines, and opting for environmentally-friendly ink, companies can cut down on material and energy costs. These savings add up over time, making it a win-win for both the environment and your bottom line.

### Enhancing Your Brand Image

Consumers today are more environmentally conscious than ever before, and they tend to support businesses that show a commitment to sustainability. By adopting sustainable printing practices, your company can boost its brand image and attract environmentally-conscious customers.

## Sustainable Printing Solutions and Their Environmental Benefits

Now, let’s examine the specific features and technologies that can help reduce the environmental impact of your printing operations.

### Duplex Printing (Double-Sided Printing)

One of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce paper consumption is duplex printing, which allows you to print on both sides of a page. This can reduce paper use by 50%, making it a highly efficient option for any business that prints frequently. By using duplex printing, you help conserve paper and minimize waste, significantly lowering your environmental footprint.

### Energy-Saving Modes

Modern printers come equipped with energy-saving modes that help reduce energy consumption when the printer is idle. These modes automatically power down the printer after a certain amount of inactivity, ensuring that energy is only used when necessary. Many energy-efficient printers also meet Energy Star certification standards, which means they use less energy without compromising performance.

### Eco-Friendly Ink Options

The ink used in traditional printing processes can significantly impact the environment. Many printers today offer eco-friendly ink alternatives, such as soy-based or water-based inks. These inks are biodegradable, contain fewer harmful chemicals, and are less toxic than traditional petroleum-based inks. Opting for printers that use eco-friendly ink options helps reduce the environmental footprint of your printing operations.

### Recycled Paper

Recycled paper is an excellent sustainable alternative to traditional paper. It’s made from post-consumer waste, which reduces the need for virgin wood pulp and conserves trees. By switching to recycled paper, businesses can significantly reduce their impact on forests and minimize waste sent to landfills.

### Print Management Software

Another key aspect of sustainable printing is [print management](https://sosny.com/print-services/managed-services/managed-print/) software, which helps organizations track and control printing activities. This software can monitor how much paper and ink each employee uses, allowing businesses to identify areas where they can cut back. It also enables businesses to enforce rules like duplex printing and restrict color printing, which uses more ink. By monitoring and optimizing your print practices, you can reduce waste and save money.

Looking to reduce your environmental footprint even further? Consider upgrading your office with refurbished or reused printers.

## How to Transition to Sustainable Printing

Making the transition to sustainable printing doesn’t have to be difficult. Here are some simple steps that any business can take:

### Step 1: Audit Your Printing Practices

The first step to transitioning to sustainable printing is evaluating your current practices. Take note of how much paper and ink your business uses, how often employees print, and whether you’re using energy-efficient printers. Conducting a print audit can identify areas where you can reduce waste and consumption.

### Step 2: Invest in Energy-Efficient Printers

Next, consider upgrading to energy-efficient printers with energy-saving modes designed to reduce power consumption. Look for printers that are Energy Star certified, as these machines are proven to use less energy while maintaining high-quality performance.

### Step 3: Implement Sustainable Printing Policies

Create and enforce sustainable printing policies within your organization. Encourage employees to print only when necessary and promote the use of duplex printing and recycled paper. With print management software, you can track employees’ printing habits and enforce sustainable policies more effectively.

### Step 4: Recycle Old Printing Equipment

As you replace old printers with more energy-efficient models, be sure to recycle your outdated equipment properly. Many electronics manufacturers offer recycling programs, which keeps old machines out of landfills and ensure that valuable materials are reused.

## Eco-Friendly Printing: Small Changes for a Big Impact

Switching from traditional printing to sustainable printing practices is an easy but effective way to reduce your company’s carbon footprint. By implementing duplex printing, using eco-friendly inks, and investing in energy-efficient machines, you can reduce paper and ink waste, lower your energy consumption, and save money.

In addition to helping the environment, sustainable printing practices can improve your company’s brand image and attract customers who are looking for environmentally-conscious businesses.

# Exploring How Eco-Printing Can Combat Climate Change

[Blog](/ecoeditorial/category/Blog)

Written By [Gareth Dinnage](/ecoeditorial?author=6329b2845480da07061259c5)

Printing has been an essential part of our lives for centuries, but traditional printing practices have significant environmental consequences. Conventional methods contribute to carbon emissions, deforestation, and pollution. These impacts exacerbate climate change, making it crucial to identify sustainable alternatives.

Eco-printing emerges as a powerful solution to address these environmental challenges. By using sustainably sourced materials, reducing chemical waste, and employing energy-efficient technologies, eco-printing offers a way to minimise the negative effects on our planet. This innovative approach not only helps combat climate change but also promotes better resource management.

In this article, we will explore the connection between printing practices and climate change, highlighting the key features of eco-printing that make it a sustainable choice. We will also discuss the environmental benefits of adopting eco-printing practices and provide actionable steps for businesses to transition to more eco-friendly printing methods. Understanding these aspects can help us make more informed decisions that positively impact the environment.

## **The Connection Between Printing Practices and Climate Change**

### **How Traditional Printing Contributes to Carbon Emissions**

Traditional printing methods are significant contributors to carbon emissions. The process involves various stages, from paper production to actual printing, each generating considerable amounts of greenhouse gases. Manufacturing paper requires large amounts of energy, typically derived from fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Additionally, the transportation of raw materials and finished products adds to the overall carbon footprint.

Printing presses themselves are often energy-intensive, using outdated technologies that consume more power. The use of petroleum-based inks and solvents further exacerbates the problem, releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to air pollution and global warming. These emissions collectively add to the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change, making traditional printing a significant environmental concern.

### **The Impact of Deforestation and Pollution**

Deforestation is another major issue linked to traditional printing. Paper production requires vast amounts of wood pulp, leading to the cutting down of trees at an unsustainable rate. Forests play a crucial role in absorbing CO2, so their destruction directly impacts our planet's ability to regulate carbon levels. Loss of forests also leads to habitat destruction, affecting wildlife and biodiversity.

Pollution from printing processes also poses severe environmental risks. The chemicals used in inks, coatings, and cleaning solvents can contaminate water sources and soil, harming ecosystems and human health. Waste generated from excess paper and offcuts often ends up in landfills, contributing to methane emissions as it decomposes. By understanding these impacts, it becomes clear why shifting to more sustainable printing practices is essential for combating climate change.

## **Key Features of Eco-Printing That Help Combat Climate Change**

### **Use of Sustainably Sourced Materials**

Eco-printing prioritises the use of environmentally friendly materials. One of the key features is the use of sustainably sourced paper, often certified by organisations like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This type of paper is produced from responsibly managed forests, ensuring that tree harvesting does not exceed growth rates. Recycled paper also plays a crucial role, reducing the need for new raw materials and conserving natural resources.

In addition to sustainable paper, eco-printing uses non-toxic inks. Soy-based and water-based inks are more environmentally friendly alternatives to petroleum-based inks. These inks reduce the emission of harmful VOCs and are often biodegradable, lessening their impact on the environment. By choosing these materials, eco-printing significantly lowers its ecological footprint.

### **Reduction of Chemical Waste and Pollutants**

Eco-printing practices focus on reducing chemical waste and pollutants. The use of cleaner technologies, such as digital printing, eliminates the need for harmful solvents and chemicals required in traditional processes. Digital printing does not produce plates, which often contain aluminium and other hazardous substances needing disposal.

Minimising toxic waste extends to the cleaning and maintenance of printing equipment. Eco-printing uses eco-friendly cleaning agents instead of harsh chemicals. This reduces the risk of water contamination and soil degradation. By addressing the waste issue, eco-printing helps protect the environment and prevents further pollution.

### **Energy-Efficient Printing Technologies**

Another essential feature of eco-printing is the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. Modern printing equipment is designed to consume less power and operate more efficiently. Energy-efficient printers reduce the overall energy demand, leading to lower carbon emissions. Implementing practices like duplex printing, which uses both sides of the paper, also helps in reducing paper waste and energy consumption.

Renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, are increasingly being used to run printing operations. This shift not only reduces the dependency on fossil fuels but also supports the global transition to cleaner energy. By embracing energy-efficient technologies, eco-printing contributes to significant reductions in greenhouse gases, playing a crucial role in combating climate change.

## **Environmental Benefits of Adopting Eco-Printing Practices**

### **Lower Carbon Footprint**

One of the most significant benefits of eco-printing is the reduction in carbon footprint. By using energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources, eco-printing drastically cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable practices, such as digital printing and the use of eco-friendly inks, minimise the release of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. This reduction in emissions helps mitigate climate change, contributing to a healthier planet.

### **Conservation of Natural Resources**

Eco-printing also promotes the conservation of natural resources. By utilising recycled paper and sustainably sourced materials, we reduce the demand for virgin resources. This approach helps preserve forests, which play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and providing habitats for wildlife. Additionally, less water is required in producing recycled paper compared to new paper, further conserving this precious resource.

### **Cleaner Air and Water Quality**

Adopting eco-printing practices leads to cleaner air and water quality. Traditional printing processes often release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other pollutants into the environment. These chemicals can contaminate air and water sources, posing health risks to humans and wildlife. Eco-friendly inks and non-toxic cleaning agents used in eco-printing significantly reduce these pollutants, ensuring cleaner and safer natural surroundings.

## **Steps Businesses Can Take to Implement Eco-Printing**

### **Practical Tips for Transitioning to Eco-Printing**

1. Conduct an Environmental Audit: Assess your current printing practices to identify areas where improvements can be made. Understanding your environmental impact is the first step in making meaningful changes.

2. Choose Sustainable Materials: Switch to recycled paper and eco-friendly inks. Look for certifications like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) to ensure the materials are responsibly sourced.

3. Use Energy-Efficient Equipment: Invest in modern, energy-efficient printers and copiers. These devices consume less power and produce less waste, lowering your carbon footprint.

4. Educate Employees and Clients: Inform your staff and customers about the benefits of eco-printing. Encourage them to adopt sustainable practices and support your eco-friendly initiatives.

## **Tools and Technologies for Sustainable Printing**

Several tools and technologies can help businesses transition to eco-printing:

* Digital Printers: These printers reduce waste by printing only the required quantity, thus eliminating excess.
* Eco-Friendly Inks: Soy-based and water-based inks are less harmful to the environment compared to traditional petroleum-based inks.
* Automated Energy Management Systems: These systems optimise energy use, reducing power consumption and operational costs.
* Duplex Printing: Enable duplex printing to automatically print on both sides of the paper, cutting paper use by half.

## **Benefits for Businesses and the Planet**

Implementing eco-printing practices can yield numerous benefits for businesses and the planet. Companies can reduce operational costs by using less energy and materials while enhancing their brand image by aligning with sustainable values. Eco-printing also contributes to broader environmental goals, such as reducing carbon emissions and conserving natural resources. These efforts not only support the fight against climate change but also promote a healthier and more sustainable future for everyone.

## **Conclusion**

Eco-printing presents a powerful solution to the environmental challenges posed by traditional printing practices. By embracing sustainable materials, reducing chemical waste, and using energy-efficient technologies, we can significantly lower our environmental impact. The shift to eco-printing offers clear benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions, conservation of natural resources, and improved air and water quality.

## **Eco-Printing Techniques Compared**

So, what is flexographic, digital, and offset printing, and what are their advantages for a printing business that has sustainability as one of its key concerns?

## **Flexographic Printing**

Flexographic, or flexo, printing utilises a flexible polymer printing plate to transfer inked images onto substrates. Because water-based, solvent, or UV-based inks can be used, flexo printing is highly [versatile and suited to many different applications](/what-is-the-flexographic-printing-process) and substrates. In terms of sustainability, flexographic printing is a particularly efficient and practical solution for label and packaging production, as it is low on resources, energy, and costs.

![Flexographic printing method](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l_8DOqldfWme0qIN3b0qfC_wSkqoEGREs0Jpkom60FWhCkyZfAt9-V8f6rOeY7FRoZhhi28JeHXJY1b_CEJN1TYJmfziTMAEu6n3QgLEEAi2H4I651z1fMHIRB4mrSuO9Wfp40_ZsDH0d9kFmdosCg)All flexographic printing methods require high energy level drying systems , utilising Hot Air, Infrared or combination of both for water & Solvent based inks, but these can be managed on modern presses.  UV inks will require specialist UV curing systems , another high consumer of energy.

World Water Day provides a crucial reminder of water’s monumental role in sustaining industries and promoting economic growth. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2024 underscores this connection, providing in-depth insights into how water management and industrial practices shape each other. This article summarizes the key findings from Chapter 4, focusing on trends, challenges, and innovative solutions in water usage within the industrial sector.

## Industrial Water Use and Challenges

Corporate supply chains are estimated to be responsible for roughly two-thirds of global water use, contributing to 70% of freshwater pollution. The worst offenders are mining, manufacturing, energy, food, textiles, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. While revealing a nuanced water usage landscape with a trend toward reduced water withdrawals, the operational risks associated with water sourcing and supply chains remain significant. Energy production initiatives alone account for approximately 10% of global water usage.

Companies heavily dependent on water, particularly smaller firms in developing countries, face substantial declines in sales and employment during urban water service disruptions. The economic impact of “dry shocks” substantially outweighs that of “wet shocks,” with companies experiencing significant sales losses during water outages, underlining the critical nature of reliable water services.

## Water Quality and Pollution

Economic growth can suffer considerably due to industrial pollution, with the mining and metals industry and the information technology sector identified as key contributors to metal pollution in water bodies. The textile industry also emerges as a major water polluter, mainly through dyeing processes. These pollutants harm ecosystems and pose serious health risks. The report stresses the importance of decoupling water use from industrial production to mitigate these impacts and enhance water quality for broader community benefit.

## Introduction

Sustainable water management practices in these regions would help address the immediate need for cleaner water and the long-term goal of ecosystem recovery, fostering a healthier environment and a stronger, more resilient community (Cook et al., 2021; Johnston and Cushing, 2020; Su et al., 2024). Industrial activities are among the leading contributors to water pollution globally, discharging a range of hazardous substances, including heavy metals, chemicals, and organic pollutants, into water systems (Jiang et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2022; Zhan et al., 2024). This type of pollution disrupts the ecological balance of rivers, lakes, and coastal areas, impacting aquatic organisms and compromising biodiversity (Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2024). Industries' pollutants degrade water quality and accumulate in the food chain, affecting human health (Akhtar et al., 2021; Rathi et al., 2021; Zhuang et al., 2024). As industrial production continues to grow to meet global demands, addressing the environmental impacts of wastewater becomes a crucial challenge, requiring immediate and long-term solutions (Rakib et al., 2019; Ritter, 2002; Xu et al., 2024). Local economies suffer when fisheries are diminished, farmland is polluted, and recreational areas are closed due to water quality issues (Chu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024). This, in turn, can result in loss of employment, increased healthcare costs, and a decline in property values in affected areas (Feng et al., 2021; Wlostowski et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2014). Consequently, water pollution becomes an issue of social equity, as vulnerable populations bear the brunt of industrial waste without benefiting from the economic advantages of nearby industrial activity. Therefore, sustainable pollution control in industrial areas is critical, as it offers a pathway to improve both environmental and public health, promote social equity, and foster a more responsible relationship between industries and the communities they impact (Gude, 2017; Plappally and Lienhard, 2013). Sustainable pollution control is essential in preserving water resources for future generations by minimizing resource depletion and promoting eco-friendly practices (Awewomom et al., 2024). These sustainable practices align closely with international environmental goals, particularly the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Davarpanah, 2024). Specifically, SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water) all emphasize the importance of sustainable water management and pollution control. By implementing practices that adhere to these goals, industries can help reduce pollution loads, conserve water, and protect aquatic life from hazardous contaminants (Awewomom et al., 2024; Gunawan et al., 2020). This alignment with public and regulatory expectations fosters a more resilient and adaptive industry capable of maintaining its economic performance while respecting the limits of natural resources and supporting a cleaner, safer environment for all stakeholders (Dantas et al., 2021; Kandpal et al., 2024; Lieder and Rashid, 2016).

Industrial wastewater pollution remains a major environmental challenge, necessitating effective and sustainable treatment solutions (Abdullahi et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2023). Various treatment techniques have been developed to address this issue, each with distinct advantages and limitations. This study focuses on four widely used methods—membrane filtration, activated carbon filtration, biological treatment, and chemical precipitation—and assesses their sustainability in industrial water pollution control (Cevallos-Mendoza et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2023). Membrane Filtration consists of multiple subtypes, each with varying pollutant removal efficiencies. These include Microfiltration (MF) for suspended solids, Ultrafiltration (UF) for macromolecules, Nanofiltration (NF) for divalent salts, and Reverse Osmosis (RO) for removing the smallest dissolved contaminants. While RO provides the highest purification, it has higher energy demands and membrane fouling risks (Asif and Zhang, 2021). Activated Carbon Filtration has two primary forms: Granular Activated Carbon (GAC), which is commonly used in large-scale water treatment for extended contact times, and Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), which is more effective for short-term pollutant adsorption but requires frequent replenishment. The efficiency depends on pore structure and surface area, impacting their applicability across industries (Mobasser et al., 2022). Biological Treatment encompasses Aerobic, Anaerobic, and Biofilm-based methods. Aerobic treatment (e.g., activated sludge, trickling filters) efficiently degrades organic matter but requires oxygenation, increasing operational costs. Anaerobic digestion is more energy-efficient, producing biogas as a byproduct, but operates slower. Biofilm-based systems (e.g., moving bed biofilm reactors) improve adaptability to varying wastewater compositions (Wang et al., 2023). Chemical Precipitation varies based on the type of coagulant or precipitating agent used. Coagulation and Flocculation use aluminum or iron salts to aggregate pollutants, while Electrochemical Precipitation applies electrical currents to precipitate heavy metals, reducing the need for additional chemicals. While effective, these methods generate sludge that requires careful disposal (Shrestha et al., 2021). The study categorizes each treatment method based on its subtypes to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The evaluation considers broad classifications and specific technological variations within each technique. For example, both high-energy RO systems and lower-energy MF/UF methods are assessed in Membrane Filtration. Similarly, in Biological Treatment, differences between aerobic and anaerobic processes are factored into the ranking process. This approach ensures that industries can select the most suitable option based on operational conditions and pollutant profiles. By integrating sustainability considerations into the assessment, this research provides industries with actionable insights for choosing the most sustainable water pollution control method.

(Nie et al., 2018) addressed this by integrating sustainability dimensions into the water security framework and establishing a standard for converting observation data, using linguistic distribution assessments to reflect the qualitative nature of water security indicators. A multi-stage decision support system is developed to evaluate water security sustainability by combining MCDM methods such as the Best-Worst Method (BWM), DEMATEL, and TOPSIS. In-depth analyses of evaluation results and key factors are provided to validate the reliability of the findings and support improved water security sustainability. The complex dynamics and uncertainties surrounding water resources make practical decision-making challenging. In this study, two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods—Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)—are applied to identify the optimal climate adaptation strategy for agriculture in Iran's Gharanghu basin over a projected period from 2040 to 2069. Reservoir efficiency indexes serve as the evaluation criteria, with expert input determining the relative importance of each criterion. Five management scenarios were assessed, each involving a 5–25 % reduction in agricultural water demand. Using AHP, criteria weights were consolidated to rank scenarios, with the 25 % demand reduction emerging as the most favorable, holding a weight of 33.5 %. In contrast, TOPSIS results highlighted the 15 % reduction as the top choice, weighted at 20.8 %. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses assessed the scenarios' resilience against climate variability. This demonstrates that integrating uncertainty into MCDM models is essential for identifying sustainable and robust management responses under evolving climate conditions (Golfam et al., 2019).

Previous studies on industrial water pollution control have explored various treatment methods, including chemical and mechanical filtration, which are effective but often costly and energy-intensive. Recent research has shifted toward sustainable practices such as constructed wetlands, bioremediation, and low-energy filtration systems, alongside circular economy approaches like wastewater recycling to reduce freshwater consumption. However, there remains a research gap in systematically prioritizing these sustainable measures while balancing effectiveness, cost, and environmental impact. This study addresses this gap by applying the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach, specifically the TOPSIS method, to evaluate and rank four key pollution control methods—Membrane Filtration, Activated Carbon Filtration, Biological Treatment, and Chemical Precipitation—based on treatment effectiveness, cost-efficiency, environmental impact, scalability, and regulatory compliance. The results identify Membrane Filtration as the most sustainable option due to its high pollutant removal efficiency and low ecological footprint, followed closely by Activated Carbon Filtration, which, despite strong pollutant reduction capabilities, has higher operational costs. The novelty of this research lies in integrating sustainability principles within the MCDM framework. By incorporating environmental impact, resource conservation, and regulatory compliance, this framework moves beyond traditional evaluations. This framework serves as a practical tool for industries and policymakers to adopt sustainable pollution control strategies that align with global environmental objectives, contributing to more resilient regional water resource management. The process begins with Problem Definition, identifying industrial water pollution challenges. A Literature Review explores existing treatment methods and sustainability gaps, followed by Method Selection, where four key pollution control techniques are chosen. Next, Criteria Definition establishes evaluation factors such as effectiveness, cost, environmental impact, scalability, and compliance. The TOPSIS method is then applied for Multi-Criteria Decision Making, leading to the Evaluation & Ranking of control methods. Results highlight Membrane Filtration as the most sustainable option, with Activated Carbon Filtration as an alternative. The findings are then analyzed in the Discussion, emphasizing their implications for industry and policy. Finally, the Conclusion presents a structured framework for sustainable water management. (See Fig. 1).

## Abstract

Sustainable wastewater management is essential for conserving water resources and reducing environmental pollution. Traditional wastewater treatment methods primarily aim to purify water for reuse, yet they often involve high energy consumption, extensive chemical use, and loss of potentially recoverable resources, which pose sustainability challenges. With approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide currently lacking access to clean water—a number projected to exceed 3 billion by 2025—water scarcity has become an urgent issue. Traditional wastewater treatment processes handle around 330 billion cubic meters of water annually; however, they account for 3–4% of global energy consumption and produce 300 million tons of carbon emissions. This situation underscores the need for more sustainable treatment methods. Innovative wastewater treatment technologies have the potential to facilitate the reuse of approximately 50 billion cubic meters of water each year, helping to alleviate water scarcity. Additionally, energy recovery from these processes aims to achieve an annual energy savings of 20 TWh, in contrast to conventional treatment methods. This article examines recent advances in sustainable wastewater management technologies, specifically focusing on biological, physicochemical, and membrane-based processes. It discusses strategies for optimizing these processes to minimize environmental impact. Furthermore, innovative approaches, such as advanced oxidation processes and energy recovery, are explored for their potential to harness energy and recover nutrients from wastewater. The article concludes that implementing innovative strategies in sustainable wastewater management can significantly contribute to water conservation, energy savings, and a reduction in carbon footprint.

## 1. Introduction

Water is a limited natural resource essential for human use and survival. For this reason, access to a reliable and clean water source is crucial for human survival and sustainable development [[1](#B1-agriculture-14-02111)]. With the rapid increase in population and industrialization in recent years, existing water resources are being depleted and increasingly polluted. As a result, water consumption is rising to meet the growing demand for water and food, leading to escalating water scarcity [[2](#B2-agriculture-14-02111)]. According to the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), approximately 1 L of water is required to produce each calorie consumed as food [[3](#B3-agriculture-14-02111)]. This excessive resource consumption also leads to an increase in waste. Consequently, our natural resources are under threat, with water being the most critical resource at risk [[4](#B4-agriculture-14-02111)]. Estimates from the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) suggest that more than 3 billion people will face water scarcity by 2025 [[5](#B5-agriculture-14-02111)].

It is, therefore, of great importance to re-evaluate wastewater generated through water consumption and make it sustainable through innovative approaches and emerging technologies across various fields. Reusing wastewater—creating sustainable water sources—provides a new means to protect existing water resources and meet the rising demand for water [[6](#B6-agriculture-14-02111)]. Recycled water is regarded as an alternative to natural water sources, offering a reliable supply of water [[2](#B2-agriculture-14-02111)]. The primary goal of treating and recycling wastewater is to safeguard existing water sources and reduce the strain on clean water resources [[6](#B6-agriculture-14-02111)].

Sustainable wastewater management has become a critical agenda item for protecting water resources and supporting environmental sustainability, especially given the rapidly growing population and industrialization. Traditional wastewater treatment methods aim to make water reusable through physical, chemical, and biological processes. However, these methods often fall short of sustainability goals due to high energy consumption, environmental impacts from chemical usage, and

Hallstedt, Ola Isaksson Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden Abstract: As the application of Additive manufacturing (AM) is moving from prototyping to final product manufacturing, exploring its sustainability implications is crucial. This paper explores the sustainability impacts of AM on production tool manufacturing and the role of digitalisation in enabling sustainable tool production. It emphasizes the necessity of a design tool that helps designers adopt a holistic sustainability approach (including environmental, social and economic aspects), while also being comprehensive and user-friendly to ensure practical applications. Keywords: Additive Manufacturing, Sustainability, Sustainable Design, Digital Manufacturing 1 Introduction AM as an emerging technology offers numerous advantages over the subtractive and formative manufacturing techniques commonly referred to as ""conventional methods"". Design for AM enables design flexibility, weight reduction, and the possibility of tailored design (Gibson et al., 2015). Unlike traditional methods that remove material from a bulk, AM uses material only as needed, which minimizes material consumption and waste, aligning with sustainability goals. This helps reduction of material consumption and reducing waste, which can be in line with sustainability. Research indicates that for low-volume production and the manufacturing of complex products, AM can significantly reduce production costs (Majeed et al., 2021). As companies become increasingly aware of these benefits, the use of AM is extending beyond prototyping to include the manufacturing of final products. AM fundamentally differs from conventional techniques. For instance, it eliminates some conventional manufacturing constraints yet introduces new challenges that must be identified and considered during the design phase (Borgue et al., 2019). This fundamental change requires product designers to shift their mindset from traditional design thinking and figure out new ways of exploiting AM capabilities (Kumke et al., 2016). In parallel, sustainability awareness is increasing, and companies are deemed to take action for more sustainable practices. Despite its potential, the sustainability impacts of AM are still not fully understood and there remains much more to discover (Hegab et al., 2023). Adding to the complexity, there is currently no AM standard process model let alone being integrated with sustainability considerations, due to several factors: 1) AM is not a single technology but rather a family of technologies each with specific characteristics, and still undergoing significant development in terms of equipment, materials and processes. This rapid evolution hinders the establishment of a standardized process model. 2) standards such as those by ISO and ASTM are still under development 3) Many established companies are only beginning to integrate AM into their manufacturing ecosystems. Given these factors, it is essential to explore how sustainability can be systematically integrated into AM processes, especially in the absence of a standardized process model (Kumke et al., 2016). This study focuses particularly on the context where companies are in the initial stages of adopting AM, lacking a standardized process model. It is thus crucial to identify and integrate sustainability implications before a common AM process model becomes established (Sauerwein et al., 2019). Simultaneously, Industry 4.0 encourages companies to leverage digital technologies to enhance their operations and stay competitive in the market. AM is digital in nature and is one of the key elements of this industrial transition. However, the intersection between sustainability and digitalisation is underexplored (Despeisse et al., 2022). Therefore, it is critical to explore how digitalisation can leverage sustainable AM production. To do this, our research investigates how AM sustainability benefits can be recognized and considered in the product design phase. Further, we discuss how digitalisation can enhance the sustainable manufacturing of products. We purposefully limit the scope to the early design phase, as the decisions made at this phase have a high impact on the products’ whole lifecycle. To investigate this, a collaborative study is conducted with one of the largest Swedish Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Three production tools implemented in the production line are remanufactured with AM, sustainability benefits of AM based on literature study are explored and potential ways on how digitalisation can leverage sustainable design and manufacture of such tools are discussed. This study aims to enhance understanding of the sustainability implications of using AM for final products that are traditionally manufactured using conventional methods. It investigates the often-overlooked advantages offered by AM for such products, including improved ergonomic design and reduced material consumption. Additionally, we explore the critical role of digitalisation in supporting sustainable Sustainability Implications of Using Additive Manufacturing for Production Tool Design NordDesign 2024 design and manufacturing processes with AM, a topic that remains largely underexplored. The research questions guiding this study are: RQ1: What are the sustainability implications of AM application for production tool design? RQ2: How can digitalisation enable sustainable design and manufacture of production tools? This paper is organized in the following manner: Section 2 provides a comprehensive background on the correlation of AM, sustainability, and digitalisation. It highlights the sustainability benefits of AM as identified in literature setting the stage for our empirical investigation. Section 3 outlines the methodology employed to explore these benefits and the associated sustainability challenges in the use cases, directly addressing our first research question regarding the sustainability implications of AM for production tool design. The findings from the case study are presented in Section 4. Subsequently, Section 5 delves into a discussion that, while rooted in these findings, further addresses the second research question on how digitalisation can enable sustainable design and manufacture of production tools. The paper concludes in Section 6, summarizing our contributions and suggesting directions for future research. This study stands out due to the limited number of studies focused on the sustainability assessment of additive manufacturing of production tools found in literature and further distinguished itself by exploring the potential role of digitalisation in this context. 2 Background The impact of AM on sustainability is difficult to assess. On one hand, several studies indicate that the AM process is more energy-intensive compared to the conventional manufacturing process (Sauerwein et al., 2019). On the other hand, some point out that solely focusing on one production phase is not enough and a comprehensive lifecycle approach is needed to assess the sustainability impacts of AM (Majeed et al., 2021). For instance, the results of Gebler et al. (2014) study revealed that AM has the potential to cut costs, energy use, and CO2 emissions if considering the whole life cycle of the product. In another study, Faludi et al. (2015) performed a Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of AM with traditional CNC machining. The results indicate that one of the AM techniques outperformed other technologies. However, they claimed results vary based on usage profile, suggesting that it is not straightforward to label one process universally more environmentally friendly than the other. It is important to note that the current lifecycle assessments for conventional manufacturing do not seamlessly translate to AM, prompting suggestions for an updated framework (Tang et al., 2016). Adding to the complexity of sustainability assessment of AM, it is critical to note that sustainability goes beyond environmental aspects further including social and economic dimensions. These dimensions, i.e. ecological, social and economic, have nested interdependencies and continuously affect one another, meaning that changes in one dimension impact other dimensions (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017; Mebratu, 1998). Yet, the social sustainability implications of AM remain less explored compared to its economic and environmental aspects (Naghshineh et al., 2021). Given the multifaceted nature of sustainability assessments, it is even more challenging to compare AM with conventional manufacturing and assess the real sustainability implications of AM, particularly from a quantitative perspective (Sauerwein et al., 2019). Nevertheless, qualitative assessment remains valuable offering insights into AM characteristics aligned with sustainability objectives. The subsequent section will look into the general sustainability benefits of AM in sub-section 2.1, review of social sustainability aspects of AM in sub-section 2.2, and how digitalisation enhances more sustainable AM practice in sub-section 2.3. 2.1 General sustainability benefits of AM To benefit from the advantages of AM, parts need to be designed for AM, incorporating strategies such as topology optimisation and other design for AM guidelines. Based on the literature review, five main themes are identified as possible AM sustainability advantages, described below: • Personalisation/customisation AM enables the distinct advantage of creating customised and complex products without necessitating additional tools or extra effort (Tang et al., 2016). Such a feature can improve the performance, and functionality of the product, and reduce the need for overdesign. Further, it can add psychological value to the product. If a product is personalised, consumers tend to feel a stronger connection to it often leading to better maintenance and higher longevity (Diegel et al., 2010; Sauerwein et al., 2019). • Resource efficiency AM offers the potential to minimize waste, as in this process material is added only where needed, unlike in conventional manufacturing where material is subtracted from a larger mass (Diegel et al., 2010). Furthermore, AM enables the manufacturing of complex products, offering the possibility for functional integration which means fewer parts are NordDesign 2024 required for each product. This promotes product consolidation and reduction of material use and assembly steps leading to a more efficient process. Additionally, topology optimization is one of the features enabling the manufacturing of lightweight components that also contribute to less material consumption (Sauerwein et al., 2019). • Repairability and function enhancement Some of the AM technologies allow damaged parts to be repaired rather than replaced entirely. Moreover, AM offers design flexibility that enables design modifications in case of requirement change. For instance, Al Handawi et al. (2022) investigated an aero-engine component known as the turbine rear structure. They proposed a method to remanufacture with AM and allocate the design margins to adapt the design according to the changed requirements. Further, modular design is also feasible with AM (Borgue et al., 2019) allowing individual module replacements in case one segment fails rather than discarding the entire part. • Distributed manufacturing AM facilitates local manufacturing streamlining the supply chain and minimizing transportation dependencies. Bonham et al. (2020) explored this capacity by establishing a system connecting kayak manufacturers and service providers through a digital thread system. While the kayak data originated in one country, the tangible product was manufactured in another. • Print on demand A significant advantage of AM is the possibility of print on demand which is useful, especially in the case of spare parts manufacturing. Leveraging AM allows for digital storage of such parts that can be printed only upon demand. Often, there is an inventory of physical parts that may remain unused (Diegel et al., 2010). Transitioning to digital inventory leads to less material consumption and more storage room (Ford and Despeisse, 2016). 2.2 Social sustainability Naghshineh et al. (2021) identified 42 social impacts that AM has on various stakeholders such as workers, value chain actors, local communities, consumers, and society at large. One significant social benefit of AM is its facilitation of local manufacturing, which can lead to local empowerment. This shift not only fosters education and training opportunities for community members but also enhances local economic development. However, the introduction of AM leads to a high degree of automation, which impacts labor demand. While automation reduces the time workers spend directly involved in the manufacturing process (Mehrpouya et al., 2021), it can also lead to health concerns, such as issues related to material toxicity and nanoparticle emissions (Arifin et al., 2022). Additionally, this automation may lead to worker isolation, potentially causing psychological problems. On a positive note, AM significantly improves design capabilities, facilitating a more open collaboration among stakeholders through co-creation (Rayna et al., 2015). This capability allows organizations to engage more directly with customers and incorporate their feedback into product designs. Beltagui et al. (2020) explored this benefit in the context of a mobile phone producer that enabled customers to personalize their mobile cases, enhancing supply chain innovation and consumer satisfaction. Despite these insights, the social sustainability impacts of AM remain overlooked, highlighting the need for further research in this area (Graziosi et al., 2024; Matos and Jacinto, 2019; Naghshineh et al., 2021) 2.3 Digitalisation Hallstedt et al. (2020) emphasize the necessity for industries to prioritize digitalisation, such as data collection and analysis, to be strong players in the future. In the context of AM, this digitalisation is integral as the process starts with creating a 3D model, which is then digitally transferred to a printer. The following printing process largely operates autonomously, minimising human interactions. This digital approach holds significant potential for data acquisition, storage, and utilization, enhancing not only the quality of both the product and the process but also offering opportunities for more sustainable production. Further, the application of lifecycle data management systems such as Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems facilitates in-depth lifecycle knowledge of a product, which in turn can promote sustainable production (Duque Ciceri et al., 2014). For instance, Bonham et al. (2020) integrated a digital thread system tailored for the additive manufacturing of kayaks. Their platform incorporated the CO2 model and LCA to offer feedback to consumers and assess the ecological impact of the product. Further, incorporating technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things can make AM smarter. Leveraging these data-driven technologies paves the way for achieving environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Majeed et al. (2021) introduced a framework that integrates AM, big data analytics, and sustainable smart manufacturing. They demonstrated how the implemented digital tools can draw a connection between AM parameters and sustainability performance. In this case, AM parameters can be tuned for greener production by enhancing part quality and reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Moreover, numerous researchers highlight the potential of ML algorithms in improving product and process quality. For Sustainability Implications of Using Additive Manufacturing for Production Tool Design NordDesign 2024 instance, Özen et al. (2021) employed ML to assess the microstructure of the printed parts and measure the porosity. Using computational homogenisation, they obtained effective properties of the printed parts. 3 Method As highlighted in the Introduction (Section 1), many companies are in the early stages of adopting Additive Manufacturing (AM) and lack a standardized process model. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how sustainability considerations can be identified and integrated early in the AM adoption phase (Kumke et al., 2016; Sauerwein et al., 2019). This study was conducted in collaboration with a leading Swedish OEM that is in the early stages of adopting AM, aiming to assess its applicability as an alternative to traditional manufacturing methods such as welding and machining for manufacturing tools used in the production line. While the broader research initiative explored various dimensions of AM application, this paper focuses specifically on the practical sustainability implications of using AM to redesign production tools. These tools are used internally on the shop floor by the manufacturing operators and are produced in low volume for specific applications, making them suitable candidates for exploring the potential benefits of AM. To explore the practical sustainability implications of AM, three production tools were redesigned and manufactured using AM, with the goals of enhancing performance, efficiency, and cost. Details of these tools are provided in Table 1. We evaluated the sustainability benefits of AM in this scenario by identifying key sustainability drivers from the literature (outlined in Section 2) and comparing these theoretical benefits with the practical outcomes observed. Comprehensive information about the current tools was collected through eight semi-structured interviews and workshops with design engineers, manufacturing engineers, and end-users. The tools were redesigned in collaboration with a design engineer who had experience with conventional manufacturing methods. We adhered to design for AM guidelines, including topology optimization, for redesigning the parts. For validation, the redesigned tools were tested on the assembly line, and feedback was collected from end-users to assess sustainability benefits such as customization and functional enhancements. Resource efficiency was also evaluated by comparing the weight and part counts of each tool when manufactured with traditional subtractive methods versus AM. Figure 1 summarizes the methodology of the study. As shown in Table 1, the tools are traditionally made either of polymer or metal. In this study, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) with polymer printing was employed to explore whether polymer can replace metals in the current context and to assess the potential sustainability implications. Table 1. Production tool specifications, all traditionally made by subtractive manufacturing Figure 1. Methodology of the current study NordDesign 2024 4 Results 4.1 AM general sustainability benefits and challenges in the production tool context Table 2 demonstrates the tools manufactured conventionally and with AM. In the following section, results from sustainability benefits offered by AM reported in the literature are investigated within the context of production tools, along with an exploration of the associated challenges. • Personalization/customization AM offered design flexibility for all three tools. For instance, based on the discussion with the operators, a better grip for the lifting tool was required and designed which the operators found useful. Also, the grooves were added (Shown in Table 2) that can be potentially used to estimate the lifetime of the tool. These new features were added to the tool without any need for special equipment. Also, it was investigated if the tools are better to be personalized, i.e., having a personal grip that follows the shape of the fingers for the individual operator. This idea was not applicable in this case since on the shop floor one tool needs to fit all. • Resource efficiency For all three redesigned products, less material was utilized (Table 2). Further, in the lifting tool redesign, additional parts (indicated in yellow plastics in Table 2) were integrated into the main body, streamlining part consolidation (as illustrated in Table 2, the number of parts drastically decreased). Highlighting resource efficiency, the original lifting tool was in metal, whereas the new version is made in polymers with air pockets, referred to as ""infill percentage"" in AM. This not only saves material but also results in a lighter and more ergonomic design. Also, topology optimisation was applied to the washing machine basket further reducing material consumption. It should be highlighted that, in every instance, the tools' delivery time and cost were significantly reduced when compared to those produced conventionally. Nonetheless, given that the previous orders consisted of larger quantities (ranging from 10 to 20), a direct comparison may not be entirely equitable, thus specific figures have not been included in Table 2. Despite this, remains a promising opportunity to reduce overall manufacturing time and cost. • Repairability and function enhancement AM showed a good potential for both repairability and functional enhancement. Repairability was more relevant in the case of the washing machine basket as the design was modular (Table 2). Apart from the fact that these modules can be redesigned in a way that eliminates the need for screws and decreases the assembly time, it helps the repair and reuse of the part. If one module breaks after a while, instead of scrapping the whole part, the broken module can

## Abstract

Additive manufacturing (AM) produces a complex shaped product from its data, layer by layer, with high precision and much less material wastage. As compared to the conventional manufacturing process, there are many positive environmental advantages of additive manufacturing technologies. Most importantly, there is less waste of raw material and the use of new and smart materials. It appears to concentrate on the output of a component on lesser material waste, energy usage, and machine emissions. There is a need to study the environmental sustainability of additive manufacturing technologies and their applications. As more businesses aim to strengthen their eco-footprint, sustainability in AM is gaining momentum. Visionary leaders of the industry are continually challenging their employees to find new ways to reduce waste, improving their workforce's manufacturing environment, and find innovative ways to use new materials to become more sustainable. The growth in value-added components, goods, and services has resulted from these initiatives. This paper discusses the significant benefit of additive manufacturing to create a sustainable production system. Finally, the paper identifies twelve major applications of AM for sustainability. Although additive manufacturing and technological dominance are being established with crucial industries, their sustainability advantages are visible in the current manufacturing scenario. The main goal is to identify the environmental benefits of additive manufacturing technologies over conventional manufacturing. Industries can now decide on suitable technologies to meet environmental goals.

49 1 Abstract This report provides an ecosystem analysis of cultural and creative industry (CCI) sector with regard to the adoption of new technologies and as case studies additive manufacturing and advanced materials as these two technologies are becoming consolidated in prototyping and manufacturing in many industrial sectors, but are still in their infancy in the CCI. The introduction of these two technologies, however, is the base of emerging new business models as showcased by a number of promising startups. We identified 430 CCI-startups in Europe that operate innovative products or services and that were further analysed via an online survey to which 83 companies participated. In addition, we discuss the role innovation ecosystems for the CCI development in Europe taking four ecosystems as example, namely the ‘Finnish Additive Manufacturing Ecosystem’ in Helsinki, the ‘Design Farm’ in Berlin, the ‘Sustainable and Tech Fashion’ hub in Amsterdam and “Portuguese footwear cluster” in the northern region of Portugal. Our study shows that green and digital transformations make additive manufacturing and advanced materials technologies quite worth looking into for CCI firms. The survey demonstrates a high degree of business dynamism of those companies that have fully embraced additive manufacturing and advanced materials as their operational basis. Furthermore we show that an effective ecosystem are key for deploying novel technologies to the sector, mostly composed by small and very small enterprises. 2 Acknowledgements The authors would like thank Victor Luis Portes (Sustainable and Tech Fashion) Luis Onofre (Portugal), Anastasia Zagorni (DesignFarmBerlin) and Markus Korpela (DIMECC) for their time devoted during the interviews sharing their insights.

Authors Ubaldo Spina Ramón Compañó 3 Executive summary Policy context. Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) are an essential part for the continued development of societies and important part of Europe’s economy. CCIs are knowledge-intensive and largely based on individual creativity and talent, generating growth and create jobs. But CCIs do not escape from the techno-societal or circular economy megatrend: they have to master the green and digital transition, too. In this respect, a number of EU cities and regions did already start the transition and have been very successful at tapping into the potential of CCIs to boost their socio-economic development. However, there are still too many places in Europe, which have not yet been making most of their potential. Many industrial sectors and value chains will have to go through a very rapid green and digital transformation in the next years towards a sustainable model of inclusive growth, embracing an improved environmental footprint along all steps of the value chain. Within this industrial context, investments in strategic value chains and new forms of collaboration with industry will be essential for ensuring Europe’s strategic autonomy and technological leadership. Likewise, in order to support the implementation of European value chains across EU territories, it is necessary to understand the innovation capacity in particular places, the dynamics of their actors and whether & how effective working relationships can be established across Europe. Technological Considerations. Additive manufacturing (AddManu) is increasing finding its place in the creative industries as it allows them to move from custom production towards mass-customisation, to design products with previously unattainable geometry, to reduce the manufacturing complexity, to improve material efficiency and to simplify the supply-chain. We present two dozens of startups that show how AddManu is finding its way for interiors, particularly furniture and lightning and for fashion, the application areas are clothing, footware, and jewellery. In a survey we carried out we find that AddManu is mostly employed in design stage, and that conceptual design is the process step expected to benefit most in the mid-term. In this study we analyse also CCI startups that employ advanced materials (AdvMat) in their manufacturing process, such as advanced composites, textiles & fibres, coatings, gels & foams, high-performance polymers, light alloys or nanomaterials. We exemplify our results using a dozen of startups for which advanced material constitute the backbone of their businesses. For many years the introduction of advanced materials was on grounds of technical performance and costs. More recently, social and environmental motivations prevail. Trends. Responsible consumption patterns and sustainability considerations come increasingly into the fore. In fashion, clients are increasingly demanding sustainable ""cradle to grave"" solutions, assuring the recovery and recycling dynamics set from the start of the design process. Such concepts can go beyond mere recycling, such as using fabrics that can be easily be dissolved, transformed or re-polymerised into new semi-finished products. Another aspect influencing the choice of materials is the enhanced sensitivity towards animal protection and more people practising veganism, calling for new natural fibres and materials. Examples include (i) vegan textiles made of mushroom skin and mushroom roots, (ii) naturally dyed sports shoes grown with microbes, which lose more than 70% of their mass one week of after composting or (iii) wool fibre created through biodegradable fibres. 4 This trend may become of interest for rural areas. As ‘providers of novel materials’ for CCIs industries may appear to collect, select, shred and mix significant quantities of post-consumer materials or agro-industry waste, developing compounds suitable for specific applications. CCIs in rural areas may then move up the value chain becoming ‘digital artisans’ managing the whole design service, i.e. analysing client’s needs to process fashion accessories or goods for home living. Emerging Business Models. Introducing additive manufacturing tools can change the company’s former design and manufacturing process. Likewise, materials with additional functionalities or sustainable materials serve to offer new kind of products. From a business point of view a number of conclusions can be drawn. First, new services and products can lead to new business opportunities for the CCIs. Second, AddManu and AdvMat in combination with the CCI’s digitalization will change the interaction between the stakeholders. For instance, online customer platform can change the speed and the degree of interaction between the former CCI’s providers and final consumers (prosumer). While the overall process remains as before, digitalization changes the roles and activities of the stakeholders, which become more interlinked. In a traditional business a client would entering a shop to buy a product; let say a designer table. The CCI would design the table, manufacture it and sell it. In the new setting the client can take active part in the design of the product (e.g. detailing some characteristics of the table) and adapt is to the customer’s specific needs (e.g. the dimension of the table). The client becomes a ‘prosumer’. From a business model point of view, the novelty lies in the separation of design, delivery, adaptation and production as independent building blocks, which allow for potentially generating revenue streams from each of the building block. The figure underneath describes the stakeholder’s actions, the actions, the required infrastructure and the revenue model for each step. Examining tech-based CCI Startups. We screened the CCI landscape in the Europe and identified 430 companies that design and/or manufacture innovative products using additive manufacturing techniques or advanced materials as described before. These companies are active in Fashion, Fashion Design, Furniture, Furniture Design, Home Living, Interior Design, Material Provider, Service Design, Technology Provider and Marketplace. 5 56,7% of the 83 companies that took part in the survey, run very personalized services,1 mostly focusing on ‘bespoke design’,2 followed by ‘custom design’ approaches, which shows that personalization services can be the key to economically successful CCI businesses. From an IP point of view, most companies operate as Original Design Manufacturer (43%), while only few exclusively as Original Brand Manufacturer (8.4%) or Original Equipment Manufacturer (8.4%).3 With regard to the use additive manufacturing tools, some companies use AddMan exclusively for one process step: design (8%), prototyping (26%), production (8%) or as a service provider (4%). The appearance of the role ‘service provider’ is a sign of the emergence of business model based on AddManu specialisation. Another finding is that the majority of companies employ AddManu for two, three or all four steps, indicating that this technology is becoming established expanding beyond its original realm of prototyping. Design Prototyping Production As a Service Provider 10% 8% 24% 12% 26% 6% 8% 2% 4% In this sample, 27 respondents use AddManu for producing finished products, of which 4 of them do it exclusively with AddManu. These are company’s development and direct sale of goods made in 3D Printing. In terms of the most widely used additive technologies, there is an equitable distribution of all those surveyed, with a prevalence for Fused Deposition Modelling technologies. With regard to the degree of ‘internal’ digitalization, 39 out of 83 companies use advanced digital technologies in their production and services. And regarding ‘external’ Digital Customer Engagement, 26 subjects declare to involve customers within the production process, with the possibility of customization, choice or booking. Furthermore, we investigated how digitalization is influencing CCIs. Amongst the ‘digital’ CCIs, we observe three kinds of startups. The first one are those, for which IT is the centrepiece of their business; they act as ‘digital technology agents’ for other creative industries. Examples include platform (marketplaces) or technology providers (artificial intelligence, internet of things, virtual reality, bionic systems, etc.). The second group are those CCIs have integrated digital technologies in their design and internal manufacturing processes. The third group are those that, additional to the internal processes, use IT for external ones and actively involve the customers in the design or production process. 1 43.3% of respondents are engaged in business to business (B2B) services, 21.7% in business to client (B2C) services and the remaining 35% operate both B2B and B2C. 2 Custom design starts with a pre-existing template or model that can be adapted to the needs of an individual only within pre-defined limits. Contrary to custom design, in bespoke design products are ""made-to-measure"" or ""made-to-order"". 3 The remaining percentage are companies to which the question does not apply 6 Ecosystems. Innovative CCI startups seldom appear in isolation, rather they emerge as a spin-off of previously existing industries or in environments with a high density of creative talents. Several countries have realized the importance of nurturing the CCI ecosystem. Examples of geographical hubs that pursuit contribute to strengthening an innovation driven ecosystem include the DesignFarmBerlin in Berlin (focusing on smart textile wearable technologies), the Finnish Additive Manufacturing Ecosystem in Vaasa (3D printed furniture and biocomposites for 3D printing), FAMEST in Madeira (sustainability and circular economy applied to biomechanics and sensed foodware), Porto Global Hub (a design factory for applied research and industrial collaboration), ClickNL in Eindhoven (diverse activities for local creative industries) or ‘REG X’ in Vejle in Southern Denmark, (providing IT services and design support for user experience and user interaction). Policy Considerations. CCI ecosystems contribute to economic, societal and environmental policy challenges. It is claimed that they may contribute fighting against the depopulation of rural areas, avoiding migration to urban areas. We observe, however, that most innovative CCI startups are located in traditional innovation hotspots like Berlin or Amsterdam. It is in these metropolitan areas where an ecosystem exist where talented people and technology wise can meet and find the infrastructure, capacities and funds to advance promising projects. In rural areas where the density of talented people is lower, the importance of organizations promoting measures to tighten networks and support innovation are more critical. Examples of organization whose aim is to integrate specific local knowledge with the opportunities deriving from new technologies include FAMEST in Madeira, FAME in Vaasa or REG X in Vejle. Whether in metropolitan or rural areas, there seems to be need to support startups with hands-on practical training on technological, and particular digital, support for design, modelling and manufacturing. Key conclusion. As whole, CCI industries still have a long way to go to master the green and digital transition. This study, however, shows that there are hundreds of innovative firms and startups in Europe that have already mastered this transition. They make use of state-of- the art technology (digital tools, additive manufacturing, use of advanced materials, etc.) in their respective business process steps that allow them to master societal and environmental demands (sustainable production, animal-free materials, recycled materials, etc.), while staying economically robust. The support of a functioning local, placed-based innovation ecosystem is key to promote and help companies which are still in the transition phase. The case studies presented in this study show that such ecosystems can emerge in different geographical environments taking into account the specificities and needs of the regions. 7 1 Introduction Many industrial sectors and value chains will have to undergo a very rapid green and digital transformation in the coming years towards a sustainable model of inclusive growth, embracing an improved environmental footprint along all steps of the value chains. Within this industrial context, investments in strategic value chains and new forms of collaboration with industry will be essential for ensuring Europe’s strategic autonomy and technological leadership. Likewise, in order to support the implementation of European value chains across EU territories, it is necessary to understand the innovation capacity in particular places, the dynamics of their actors and whether & how variable geometry coalitions across Europe can be established. Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) are an essential part for the continued development of societies and important part of Europe’s economy. CCIs are knowledge-intensive and largely based on individual creativity and talent, generating growth and create jobs. But neither CCIs do escape from the techno-societal or circular economy megatrend: they too have to master the green and digital transition. In this respect, a number of EU cities and regions did already start the transition and have been very successful at tapping into the potential of CCIs to boost their socio-economic development. However, there are still too many places in Europe, which have not yet been making most of their potential. The aim of this report is to analyse a number of place-based innovation ecosystems in promising segments of the Creative Industry. The report reviews specifically the impact of additive

These case studies not only provide instances of the economic feasibility of environmentally friendly materials in various sectors, but also highlight the significance of 3D printing in promoting sustainable manufacturing methods. The adoption of sustainable materials in additive manufacturing is crucial for realizing the complete potential of this technology as an ecological solution, as shown by these applications -. The degree of recyclable and reusable materials used in 3D printing varies. PLA is well-known for its recyclability and reusability, but substances like ABS, PETG, Nylon, & TPU are also capable of recycling but need additional consideration due to factors like as their melting points and post-recycling characteristics.

Review of Existing Materials in Additive Manufacturing The field of advanced manufacturing has always been defined by the presence of many synthetic materials, each chosen for their distinct features that are appropriate for a wide range of 2 E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024)  ICARAE2023 applications . The materials that are used most frequently in multiple uses are thermoplastics, such as the thermoplastics ABS and poly (lactic acid) (PLA), tabulation of materials in table.1. These substances are highly regarded because of the user-friendly nature and comparably affordable price. In order to enhance the durability and performance of various use, materials such as [...] expectations for sustainable products have created a substantial market opportunity for enterprises that choose to employ sustainable additive manufacturing practices. Numerous instances of effective integration of sustainable practices in additive manufacturing may be discovered across several industries -.

Keywords: Sustainable Manufacturing, 3D Printing Materials, Green Manufacturing, Environmental consideration, Resource Efficiency, Waste Reduction. 1. Introduction Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, has become a key driver in modern manufacturing, presenting excellent diversity in both design and production operations. [1] This particular technology, once dedicated to a specialized field is currently playing an essential part in various industries such as aviation, medical treatment, and automotive[2]. This study attempts to explore the ecological effects of traditional 3D printing techniques and materials and intends to reduce these concerns by examining potential available through environmentally friendly materials [3]. The final objective is to advance the field of manufacturing by promoting environmentally friendly methods [4]. The background of the practice of additive manufacturing can be linked back to the early 1980s when the technology was first developed. Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, is a process that involves building three-dimensional. The process of additive manufacturing, that requires the gradual addition of material to create items, has greatly influenced the method of visualizing and producing various products [5]. When compared with conventional subtractive manufacturing methods that require the removal of material from a greater block, additive manufacturing permits the creation of complex designs while avoiding material waste throughout the production process [6]-[9].

E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202450501009 ICARAE2023 facilitated the quick generation of prototypes, the customization of goods, and the manufacture of intricate designs, which were previously impossible or economically unfeasible. As the evolution of this technology grows, its applications have undergone expansion, reaching multiple sectors that have given rise to innovations that correspond with the ever-evolving requirements of contemporary society [10]. The current investigation aims to examine the environmental concerns associated with standard 3D printing methods [11]. Although typical 3D printing offers various benefits, it is also followed by notable consequences for the environment. The consumption of various materials, such plastics and resins, mainly comes from finite resources and has a negative effect on the environment through the production process and as wasted trash [12]. The highly energy-intensive nature of these methods, along with the release of pollutants and the generation of potentially hazardous byproducts, lead to the enhancement of the ecological impact of additive manufacturing [13]-[16]. The negative environmental impacts associated with 3D printing have prompted investigations over the long-term viability of this technology, hence requiring a transition towards more sustainable methodologies and materials. Fig.1 Comparative chart of different manufacturing process [18] The main purpose of this research is to examine and advocate for the utilization of environmentally friendly resources in the field of additive manufacturing, particularly with the goal of reducing the environmental risks associated with 3D printing [17]-[19]. The goal of this research is to investigate a variety of renewable materials, analyze their viability and efficacy, and evaluate their potential in limiting the environmental impact of additive manufacturing. The study's concentrate extends beyond simple material substitutes, embracing a comprehensive approach to sustainability manufacturing processes. This includes considerations of energy usage, waste reduction, and lifespan analysis. The objective of this study is to give valuable information and suggestions for manufacturers, governments, and researchers, with a goal of promoting a change towards additive manufacturing procedures that are more environmentally sustainable [20]. 2. Review of Existing Materials in Additive Manufacturing The field of advanced manufacturing has always been defined by the presence of many synthetic materials, each chosen for their distinct features that are appropriate for a wide range of 2 E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202450501009 ICARAE2023 applications [21]. The materials that are used most frequently in multiple uses are thermoplastics, such as the thermoplastics ABS and poly (lactic acid) (PLA), tabulation of materials in table.1. These substances are highly regarded because of the user-friendly nature and comparably affordable price. In order to enhance the durability and performance of various use, materials such as Polyamide (commonly known as polyester), resins, as well as metals like as titanium and aluminum are utilized [22]. These materials have played a crucial role in helping to improve the expansion and adaptability of 3D printing technology, which allows for the manufacturing of a wide range of objects, including basic domestic goods to complicated parts utilized in aeronautical and medical domains [23]-[27]. The selection of materials in additive manufacturing has a crucial role in determining the mechanical characteristics, surface quality, and long-term durability of the end product. Ecologically friendly 3D printing materials, for example PLA and PETG, offer the same degree of performance and durability compared to traditional materials like ABS. ABS is impact-resistant and appropriate for high-temperature applications, PETG blends strength and flexibility, and PLA has been easy to use but may be weak. While selecting a material, take the particular application into account. Table. 1 Eco-friendly Materials for Green 3D Printing [28] Material Source Biodegradability Main Applications Polylactic Acid (PLA) Corn starch, sugarcane Yes Prototyping, consumer products Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) Microbial fermentation Yes Medical, biodegradable products Algae-Based Filaments Algae Varies Specialty printing, artistic Recycled PET (rPET) Recycled PET bottles No Containers, functional objects Wood Composites Wood particles Varies Decorative items, prototypes Bamboo Filaments Bamboo fibers Varies Decorative items, natural aesthetics The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a process that examines the potential adverse effects of a proposed project or expansion. The rising issue lies in the environmental damage associated with these traditional materials [29]. Materials such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and other plastics made from petroleum sources have been demonstrated to have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution of the environment. This impact is observed through their life cycle, covering both the production phase and the subsequent disposal stage [30]. The life cycle of these products frequently culminates in their disposal in incinerators or garbage dumps, given that many of them lack the ability to undergo biodegradation or recycling. The metals utilized in the process of 3D printing, despite their built-in durability, necessitate energy-intensive manufacturing procedures that give rise to a significant amount of industrial 3 E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202450501009 ICARAE2023 waste [31]. The ecological impact of these products extends beyond their disposal stage, encompassing the carbon dioxide consumption and emissions associated with their production process, transportation, and utilization throughout the lifecycle of the printed items. In addition to their environmental effects, typical materials used in 3D printing show other technological and practical constraints [32]. A number of these materials exhibit limitations with respect to printing conditions, including temperature specifications and sensitivity to warping or shrinking. This restriction restricts their suitability for complicated or extensive printing activities [33]. The mechanical properties of certain polymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), often exhibit insufficiency in terms of toughness and resilience, hence limiting their applicability in industrial environments requiring higher stress tolerance [34]-[39]. Also, an increasing concern has emerged regarding the potential health hazards linked to specific substances, specifically in relation to the emission of fumes and ultrafine particles generated during the process of printing. The constraints highlight the importance for ongoing development and research in alternative materials that can address these shortcomings while following to sustainable principles in the field of additive manufacturing [40]. 3. Methodological Approach and Experimental Evaluation of Sustainable Materials in Additive Manufacturing It begins with an in-depth review of literature in order to find out which environmentally friendly supplies had been in use for 3D printing. The goal was to collect an extensive variety of materials that are recommended or used in the 3D printing industry for ecological reasons. Materials with the least adverse impacts on the environment, like cellulose composites, reused plastics, and biodegradable polymers, were selected according to the literature review. The materials were categorized based on their history, ability to break down naturally, and their suitability for reuse in the 3D printing process. The selection process was accompanied by experimental testing to evaluate each material's mechanical properties, printability, and environmental impact. Tests were conducted on tensile strength, adaptability, and rates of decline under various conditions. Printability evaluations concentrated on how appropriate each material was to different 3D printing procedures, including Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). The environmental impact evaluation, which evaluated the carbon footprint, consumption of energy, and waste production of utilizing every component in 3D printing processes, was a crucial part of the study. It was carried out using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique. This evaluation also took into account the possibility of lessening environmental effects by recycling and reusing materials. A survey was carried out among both manufacturers and consumers in the 3D printing industry to add to the experimental results. The goal was to collect useful data about the actual difficulties, tastes, and views related to the use of environmentally friendly materials in the process of additive manufacturing. The suitability of every material for environmentally friendly 3D printing applications was determined via analysis of the data that was gathered. A collection of recommendations for introducing eco-friendly materials into additive manufacturing procedures resulted from this study, which evaluated the material qualities, their impact on the environment, and the opinions of users. 4 E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202450501009 ICARAE2023 Fig.2 Steps for evaluating eco-friendly materials in green 3D printing. To obtain knowledge on eco-friendly materials in 3D printing, the researchers thoroughly reviewed data from the industry, current academic journals, and other relevant publications. They may look into studies regarding the application of biodegradable PLA (Polylactic Acid) in additive manufacturing, for example. Based upon the evaluation of current literature, resources such as recycled PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) and bio composites are selected and categorized based on characteristics such as their source and ability to be reused. For example, bioplastics derived from algae can be categorized by researchers as a renewable resource. In order to analyzing the endurance & flexibility of a bamboo fiber-reinforced filament to determine its suitability for use in the structural components of 3D printing. Evaluating the suitability of a cornstarch-based bioplastic with FDM printers, takes into consideration parameters that include melting point and interlayer bonding. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine the carbon footprint and overall environmental impact linked to the manufacturing and removal of a particular green filament. In order to calculate performance of each material, the test results are examined. For example, analyzing the tensile test data to assess the relative durability of various biodegradable fibers. 5 E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202450501009 ICARAE2023 4. Green Manufacturing Processes in 3D Printing The present research seeks to investigate various categories of sustainable materials that are able to be utilized for 3D printing applications, as shown in fig.3. Extensive research efforts have been made focused towards the development of environmentally friendly alternatives because of the environmental and health-related concerns linked to conventional materials used in 3D printing. The increasing use of biodegradable polymers, represented by Polylactic Acid (PLA), is mainly led by their reduced ecological footprint in compared to plastics derived from petroleum. But there is an increasing number of novel materials in the field, such as Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and Polycaprolactone (PCL), that demonstrate the biodegradability and are sourced from sources that are renewable. In addition to polymers, there has been an increasing scientific attention to bio-composites, which involve the mixture of natural fibers such as wood, flax, or hemp with bioplastics [41]-[45]. This blend serves to improve the mechanical features of the materials while maintaining their potential to undergo biodegradation [46]. Also, there is an increasing adoption of recycled materials, such as recycled PET (rPET) and recycled ABS, in the area of 3D printing. This development matters as it helps the establishment of a circular economy within the industrial sector. When doing a comparison between these environmentally friendly materials and traditional alternatives, it is important to take consideration both their performance characteristics and their sustainability qualities. Biodegradable polymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), show comparable accessibility to acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene (ABS), while exhibiting a significantly decreased ecological impact [47]. However, it is possible that certain substances may exhibit inadequate mechanical strength for certain usages. On the other hand, bio-composites offer increased mechanical properties and durability, giving them viable for an increased number of uses; at this point their printing capability can present more problems. Although recycled materials are viewed as sustainable, they may exhibit variations in quality when compared with virgin materials. This comparative analysis indicates that whereas eco-friendly materials are making progress in terms of environmental sustainability there exists an unstable balance between the environmental advantages and functional performance [48]. Fig.3 Lifecycle analysis of 3d printing processes [45] The present study concentrates on the examination as well as evaluation of case studies and their practical applications [48]. Several case studies demonstrate the effective utilization of 6 E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202450501009 ICARAE2023 these environmentally friendly materials in the framework of 3D printing. One remarkable case is to the use of polylactic acid (PLA) in retail products and packaging, whereby its biodegradable nature presents a significant ecological benefit. The automotive industry is currently investigating the use of bio-composites as a means of producing lightweight and sustainable parts [49]. Another pioneering use is the commercialization of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for the manufacturing of components within the fashion industry, which promotes sustainability within a previously environmentally harmful domain. These case studies not only provide instances of the economic feasibility of environmentally friendly materials in various sectors, but also highlight the significance of 3D printing in promoting sustainable manufacturing methods. The adoption of sustainable materials in additive manufacturing is crucial for realizing the complete potential of this technology as an ecological solution, as shown by these applications [50]-[53]. The degree of recyclable and reusable materials used in 3D printing varies. PLA is well-known for its recyclability and reusability, but substances like ABS, PETG, Nylon, & TPU are also capable of recycling but need additional consideration due to factors like as their melting points and post-recycling characteristics. To make wise choices concerning sustainable 3D printing procedures, it's essential to explore specific materials and ways to recycle them. Fig.4 Simulation of layer deposition of 3D printed objected [52]. 5. Challenges and Opportunities in Sustainable Additive Manufacturing The growing number of its applications the relevance of sustainability concerns has become of the highest order [54]. This study explores the different barriers and potential advantages associated with the integration of sustainable methodologies into additive manufacturing. It focuses a priority on need for eco-friendly materials, enhanced energy efficiency, and the minimization of waste. The recent past and growth of additive manufacturing have seen an important change from its initial implementation in prototyping to its growing popularity in mainstream manufacturing. This advancement in technology has had a profound impact on various industries, including aviation, health care, automobiles, and consumer products. At its inception, the priority of sustainability was not the main objective [55]. But as ecological issues have gained prominence, the significance of incorporating sustainable practices in this domain has continuously risen. One of the major problems that occur is how heavily we rely on non-renewable materials, which often have no recyclability. The manufacturing and removal of these materials present substantial environmental risks. The process of additive manufacturing, particularly for large-scale industrial applications, is frequently characterized by high energy requirements, which has a significant environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Technological and economic barriers provide 7 E3S Web of Conferences 505, 01009 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202450501009 ICARAE2023 significant obstacles to the broad adoption of environmentally friendly supplies and technologies, mostly since their costly prices. Also, the absence of advanced technology for the purpose of attaining cost-effective and environmentally friendly manufacturing presents a substantial obstacle. This part addresses the challenges and concerns related to regulatory and standardization issues. The growth and introduction of sustainable additive manufacturing is slowed by an absence of comprehensive rules and standards that are specifically designed for this purpose [56]-[58]. Advancements in the field of eco-friendly materials have presented interesting alternatives to traditional plastics and metals, with particular attention on biodegradable

# 3D Printing and the Environmental Impact of Manufacturing

*Manufacturing is a major source of carbon emissions. Learn what steps can we take as an industry to reduce our carbon footprints — and why sustainability is a win-win for both the environment and your bottom line.*

Climate change is real and continues to be a hot topic in research, public policy, and cultural dialogue. What was once inconceivable — that human activity might impact something as incalculably vast as planet Earth itself — is now understood to be scientific fact.

  

The environmental impact of manufacturing plays a large role in climate change. Not just through energy consumed in production, but also transportation energy used to ship supplies and parts at various points in [supply chains](https://markforged.com/resources/blog/3d-printing-supply-chain-5-examples). Increasing numbers of organizations and consumers are prioritizing sustainable, environment-friendly business practices as a result.

  

Read this article for a contextual overview of climate change, why businesses benefit from environmentally conscious practices, how 3D printing more parts substantially reduces carbon emissions, and how two organizations are using Markforged 3D printers to build a more sustainable future.

[## Markforged FX10

The world's first industrial metal and composite printer - and the most versatile tool for your factory floor.]( https://markforged.com/3d-printers/fx10-tm)

**An overview of climate change**

Consequences of climate change caused by mass carbon emissions are well documented. Average temperatures are slowly but consistently increasing; weather patterns are becoming more extreme, with more pronounced droughts and harsher storms. Global warming is also melting more ice caps than ever, contributing to rising sea levels. Ecological ramifications of climate change include the destruction of fragile ecosystems and habitats: threatening long-term survival of countless species of living organisms and the planet’s overall biodiversity.

  

These translate to anthropological consequences. Extreme weather and droughts can harm crop yields and threaten food supplies around the world. Strong storms can cause loss of both property and human life. Rising sea levels also reduce the amount of habitable land: experts predict that coastal flooding will become a serious issue in the 2030s, potentially leading to displacement of coastal communities and resultant overcrowding.

**Why does environmental impact matter for manufacturers?**

**The environmental impact of manufacturing.** Factories consume quite a bit of energy. Engineering, production of goods, and transportation of parts across supply chains together account for a substantial portion of emissions contributing to climate change.

  

**But what’s in it for the business?** Businesses are increasingly recognizing that engaging in environmentally conscious practices creates tangible business benefits.

  

By reducing waste and energy consumption, sustainable manufacturing processes improve operational efficiency while making regulatory compliance easier. Sustainable business practices are also becoming the norm. As Harvard Business Review noted as far back as 2016, [research has shown](https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-comprehensive-business-case-for-sustainability) that consumers are more willing to pay higher prices for sustainably produced products and more likely to have brand loyalty. Deloitte [research has found](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Energy-and-Resources/gx-eri-sustainable-manufacturing-2021.pdf) that investors, supply chain partners, and employees also favor environmentally-conscious organizations — with over half of 750 executives reporting in 2021 that “their environmental sustainability initiatives measurably boosted their corporate financial performance.”

**The environmental impact of manufacturing and 3D printing: how does additive make a difference?**

The short answer is yes — one key way manufacturers can have a less harmful impact on the environment is by additively manufacturing whatever components they can. Conventional supply chains incur huge carbon footprints through fossil-fuel-hungry logistics bridges.

[Industrial 3D printing](https://markforged.com/3d-printers) reduces carbon footprints in a few different ways:

* **Less energy and material waste.** The [process of additive manufacturing](https://markforged.com/resources/blog/additive-manufacturing-101-guide-the-basics) itself has a far lower carbon footprint compared to subtractive processes. Additive manufacturing leads to far less waste — shapes of manufactured parts aren’t achieved through reduction of material, hollow infill structures cut down on even more material while preserving performance, and manufacturers can produce only what is needed.
* **No carbon-heavy supply chains.** Considering fabrication alone, the carbon footprint of subtractive manufacturing is already significantly higher than that of additive manufacturing. However, the substantial negative carbon footprint of traditional manufacturing is compounded by the supply chain activities these processes require to deliver the product to the point of need. After the production of goods, the necessary transportation and logistics downstream produces a carbon footprint far higher than what fabrication itself produces. By providing versatile point-of-need fabrication, 3D printing cuts out the need for these multiple carbon-intensive steps — while also creating operational efficiency.

**Examples of sustainable manufacturing in practice**

**1.) Greentown Labs and Transaera**

[Greentown Labs](https://greentownlabs.com/) in Somerville, MA, is the largest climatetech incubator in North America, a community of innovators working towards changing the way the world powers itself. Success stories out of Greentown Labs include Sweetgreen, Form Energy, Via Seaparations, and Zwitterco. The next startup positioned to change the way we think about sustainable manufacturing is [Transaera](https://www.transaera.com/). A startup spun out of MIT, Transaera is focused on building air conditioning systems that are environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and affordable.

Air conditioning specifically is a major contributor to climate change. In most households, AC is the largest electricity usage source, and therefore produces the most carbon emissions. According to Ross Bonner, CTO of Transaera, AC use accounts for 4% of global carbon emissions — which is *double* that of the aviation industry, which sits at 2%. Considering the scale of AC usage around the world, even a moderate improvement in AC efficiency and waste reduction can make a substantial improvement in the global carbon footprint. Until recently, the way air conditioners work hasn’t changed much since it was invented in the early 1900s; but using a novel, moisture-grabbing material — a type of metal organic framework (MOF) — allows Transaera’s air conditioning systems to cool the air more efficiently.

Bonner cites access to Markforged 3D printers as one major upside to working out of Greentown Labs: “When you’re trying to change the game for any technology, there are a lot of technical obstacles to overcome. The way to overcome those is through constant iteration, constantly testing things, learning things, trying the next thing and improving.”

Compared to traditional manufacturing, additive manufacturing consumes far less material during fabrication, as part shape is not achieved through reduction. Even compared to other 3D printers, Bonner states that Markforged helps Transaera manufacture their prototypes more sustainably, with less waste:

> “

> Markforged printers also don’t waste material and energy because they always produce the part that you designed — whereas with other 3D printers, there’s a lot of worry involved.”

### FAQs: 3D Printing Environmental Impact

Yes, 3D printing is environmentally friendly as it reduces waste, uses less energy, reduces emissions and uses less water. 3D printing reduces waste as 3D printing builds parts layer-by-layer, so it doesn't require cutting away from a larger volume of material. 3D printing requires less energy because it only needs to heat the printing material and run the printer. Because 3D printing requires fewer materials, it uses less energy inputs and lowers emissions as well.

Common materials used in 3D printing are thermoplastics PLA (polylactic acid), and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). PLA is environmentally friendly because it's made from materials like tapioca, corn, and sugar cane. ABS is tough as it's petro-plastic, but recyclable.

PLA is a trendy aliphatic thermoplastic polymer derived from renewable resources such as sugarcane, maize, cassava, corn, etc. It is a fully biodegradable and biocompatible biopolymer. It requires low energy consumption and produces minimum greenhouse gases during its production.

Important considerations for sustainability within AM include health-related issues, scrap material generated during production, and operator safety. Additionally, aspects such as market growth, process efficiency, and cost-effectiveness are integral to the economic features of AM. Fig. 1. The ecosystem of additive manufacturing is sustainable. A visual representation (Fig. 1) illustrates various established strategies within the ad-ditive manufacturing ecosystem that promote sustainability across these technological platforms. This framework highlights the interconnectedness of societal, economic, and environmental sustainability, with safety being a vital aspect of a comprehensive sus-tainable ecosystem. Environmental factors such as energy consumption, emissions, and recyclability are also critical for achieving complete sustainability in AM processes. One of the most notable advantages of using 3D printing in manufacturing is its ability to significantly reduce material waste and production costs. This technology enables the recycling of materials, providing considerable environmental benefits. Compared to conventional manufacturing methods, 3D printing has a more profound positive im-pact, as it reduces pollution and addresses several current issues in the manufacturing industry. Furthermore, 3D printing allows for the sustainable production of items from virtually any location, whether in a store or at home. This capability substantially de-creases the need for shipping, thereby minimizing associated pollution [13,14]. Addi-tionally, 3D-printed products can be lighter due to innovative designs and internal ge-ometries that often differ from those achievable through traditional machining tech-niques. These advancements require less energy and contribute to lower pollution lev-els. 7. Enhancing Sustainability Through Additive Manufacturing Pro-cess: Process Flow 434 G. R. Ram et al.
The process of implementing a sustainable culture within the existing additive manu-facturing (AM) framework involves several key steps. It begins with an assessment phase that includes life cycle assessments, focusing on sustainability-related character-istics. Following this, attention shifts to material considerations and their overall envi-ronmental impacts, aiming to achieve targeted sustainability within the AM sector [7,8] Next, post-assessment steps are undertaken, which are further improved by enhancing the overall additive manufacturing processes. By doing so, AM can lower energy and resource costs essential for scaling production, all without significant alterations. This enables industries to enhance the speed and profitability of their business models. Ad-ditionally, the technology contributes to reducing time-to-market and localizing pro-duction [8,9]. Such advancements positively influence the environment by addressing the challenges associated with long-distance transportation. Increased automation lev-els foster this transition, improving productivity and enhancing worker safety. This shift not only saves lives but also boosts the profitability of mining operations. Furthermore, this transformative phase opens up new market opportunities and prompts a reevalua-tion of corporate practices, maximizing the use of emerging innovations. Ultimately, this could lead to significant reductions in pollution, with AM playing a crucial role in enhancing the sustainability of our economies and communities [10] 8. How additive manufacturing improves environmental sustaina-bility. Additive manufacturing (AM) is utilized to create a diverse range of products while prioritizing environmental impact and the welfare of workers and customers. It incor-porates green and lean processing methods and includes a range of sustainability indi-cators. The entire product life cycle is designed around sustainable practices, extending from production through to end-of-life considerations, including remanufacturing and recycling [11,12]. Transforming a standard manufacturing facility into a smart factory involves both hor-izontal and vertical integration, which connects all production areas to manufacturers and customers. The seamless integration of information technology systems into Indus-try 4.0 enhances manufacturing processes and supply chain management. To achieve sustainable development, manufacturing engineers face a variety of industry-wide chal-lenges [14,15]. Designers can identify significant concerns during the product design and development phases, allowing the manufacturing sector to eliminate internal waste while increasing efficiency. Plans may be changed quickly, allowing manufacturing teams to provide the necessary components while reducing waste. These revolutionary technologies encourage sustainable production by digitizing manufacturing processes [15].By leveraging smarter designs, manufacturers can enhance efficiency through lighter materials, sustainable practices, and improved component performance. Addi-tive manufacturing helps reduce the need for additional processing and physical inven-tory. Recently, metal 3D printing has gained significant attention among leading com-panies. However, metal technologies like metal binder jetting have lagged behind Innovating Green: Effect of Additive Manufacturing on Environmental Sustainability 435 Fig.2.

It lessens dependency on commercial manufacturing by enabling the quick fabrica-tion of intricate and customized goods at home. 4 Reduce mate-rial waste It is also possible to recycle thermoplastic components made with this technology. 3D printers can be used to re-cycle a variety of other materials. Environmentally benefi-cial items can be printed with this method. Furthermore, a number of businesses have created processes for turning waste into powder that may be used in 3D printing. Metal recycling is also advancing, but the majority of recycling activities are focused on the polymer 3D printing industry. This technology will further the science of recycling in the future. 5 Reduced en-ergy consump-tion Despite improvements in metal recycling, the majority of recycling efforts are focused on the polymer 3D printing industry. The advancement of recycling science will be an-other goal of this technology in the future. In comparison to many conventional production methods, 3D printing uses less energy when producing critical materials. Gener-ally speaking, 3D printing technologies require less energy than conventional machining operations. This technology provides a straightforward and creative solution. 3D print-ing is more energy-efficient than subtractive techniques, offering a practical means of maximizing output and inven-tory needs while reducing manufacturing fuel use. 6 Material recy-cling One essential component of sustainability is the recycling and reusing of 3D printing materials. Given the high cost of materials and the fact that metal powder cannot be recy-cled, this is especially important in the 3D metal printing industry. The mechanical qualities of the materials are greatly impacted by the appropriate recycling and reuse of metal powders. This method makes powder-based opera-tions more economical and efficient. Additionally, manu-facturers are creating screening methods for metal 3D printing, which are now considered industry norms. 7 Sustainable products Using organic and biodegradable materials, additive man-ufacturing (AM) has also become a popular way to produce environmentally friendly 3D items. This technology uses PLA, which is sustainable, non-toxic, biodegradable, and produces little waste. Compared to CNC machining, its low melting temperature reduces material waste and mak-ing it appropriate for a variety of applications. Compared to conventional methods like machining, casting, and welding, metal 3D printing can be simpler for low- to mid-It uses less energy to produce this extra material. One pop-ular green technology used to create 3D printed parts is powder metallurgy. By reducing trash and energy use, this technology promotes a better environment. In addition, it is a far more environmentally friendly processing approach than conventional manufacturing methods like machining. Additionally, weight can be decreased by using lightweight materials in additive manufacturing. Additive manufactur-ing provides a number of additional sustainability benefits in addition to reducing fuel usage.

## Sustainable Logistics for Eco-Friendly Printing

Sustainability in printing extends beyond the production floor to encompass the entire supply chain and service delivery process.  
At the core of our logistical sustainable printing practices is a commitment to streamlining operations, which yields significant environmental benefits and helps reduce our carbon footprint.

### Sustainable Printing Practices in Logistics

Our approach to sustainable logistics focuses on four key areas:

[Delivery Optimization](javascript:void(0);)

[Efficient Delivery Systems](javascript:void(0);)

[Inventory Management Solutions](javascript:void(0);)

[Workflow Automation](javascript:void(0);)

### Delivery Optimization

We've implemented strategies to minimize truck deliveries, reducing the number of vehicles on the road and, consequently, lowering our carbon emissions. This involves careful route planning and consolidation of shipments where possible.

### Efficient Delivery Systems

By employing more advanced delivery systems, we've improved the speed and accuracy of our services. These systems allow for better coordination and fewer wasted trips, further reducing fuel consumption and emissions.

### Inventory Management Solutions

We've developed sophisticated inventory management techniques that help us maintain optimal stock levels. This approach prevents overproduction and reduces waste from excess or outdated materials.

The cumulative effect of these logistical improvements is twofold. First, we've achieved a notable reduction in carbon emissions associated with our operations. Second, we've minimized waste throughout our supply chain and delivery processes.

By adopting a more streamlined approach to providing our services, we're not only enhancing efficiency but also making significant strides in our sustainability efforts. These green practices demonstrate our commitment to environmental responsibility at every stage of the printing process, from production to delivery.

In addition, the process of ordering our manufacturing raw materials in bulk is one easily accessible way of improving sustainability and reducing transportation-related emissions.

### Workflow Automation

Workflow automation and connectivity has a huge amount of sustainability benefits.  For example, it assists in creating printing impositions to optimize the print to fit more print on every printed sheet efficiently. Implementing automation minimizes errors, leading to decreased waste and streamlined processes that optimize the use of resources like energy, labor, and raw materials.

## Advancing Sustainability in the Printing Industry and Lowering Carbon Emissions with Digital Printing

### Digital printing represents a significant leap forward in sustainable printing practices.

Unlike traditional offset printing, which relies on printing plates, digital printing technology allows for direct printing of digital-based images onto a variety of media substrates. This innovative process accepts digital files such as PDFs and desktop publishing files, printing them directly onto materials ranging from canvas and fabric to cardstock and paper.

The versatility of digital printing extends beyond its ability to work with diverse materials. Its true strength lies in its contribution to environmental sustainability.

Digital printers produce notably less CO2 emissions than their traditional counterparts, with many models achieving carbon neutrality by offsetting the carbon produced as a byproduct of printing.

One of the most significant environmental benefits of digital printing is its substantial waste reduction.

By eliminating the need for printing plates, which degrade over time and require replacement, digital printing circumvents a major source of waste in conventional printing processes.

This plate-free approach not only minimizes material waste but also streamlines the entire printing process, further enhancing its efficiency.

The improved efficiency of digital printing plays a crucial role in its overall sustainability.

The ability to input digital files directly into the printer reduces preparation time and materials, contributing to a more streamlined and environmentally friendly printing process.

This efficiency, combined with lower emissions and reduced waste, positions digital printing as a technology that aligns closely with modern sustainability goals.

### Embracing Digital Solutions

While we specialize in quality print products, we also recognize the value of digital solutions in reducing paper use. We offer:

## Environmentally Friendly Printing Additional Practices

At [Kase Printing](https://kaseprinting.com/fl-builder-template/certifications/ ""Kase Printing""), we're committed to implementing a wide range of sustainable printing practices to minimize our environmental impact and help our clients achieve their sustainability goals.

### [Reduced Carbon Emissions Through Energy Efficiency](javascript:void(0);)

### [Sustainable Large Format Printing](javascript:void(0);)

### [Choosing an Efficient Binding Method](javascript:void(0);)

### [Reduce the unnecessary use of plastics - Eco-Friendly printing](javascript:void(0);)

### [Advancing Recycling Initiatives](javascript:void(0);)

### Reduced Carbon Emissions Through Energy Efficiency

We've invested in energy-efficient equipment and processes that use less energy, helping to save energy and reduce our carbon footprint.

This includes:

### Sustainable Large Format Printing

Our large format printing services also adhere to eco-friendly principles.

We use:

### Choosing an Efficient Binding Method

Making the best choice for your project that balances durability with sustainability.

Hard cover binding gives longevity to a product, but with more processes and materials involved they inevitably consume more energy than paperback bindings. PUR perfect binding uses 70% less glue than EVA perfect binding, making it a more sustainable option.

Metal-based binding (Wire-O mechanical binding and wire saddle stitching) use no glues and are entirely plastic free unlike plastic coil mechanical binding.

### Reduce the unnecessary use of plastics - Eco-Friendly printing

Film and liquid-based laminations, shrink wrap, and poly bagging all help protect your printed product. Still, they also increase the processes and energy needed to recycle these materials as post-consumer waste.

Eco-friendly lamination and plastic alternatives exist, but some fail to live up to their claims regarding recyclability / biodegradation and can be prohibitively expensive.

Always consider your product's lifespan and distribution path. For example, is plastic packaging really essential, or could a paper sleeve/bellyband/carton box be an alternative?

### Advancing Recycling Initiatives

Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond sourcing to encompass comprehensive recycling efforts. We've implemented initiatives to repurpose wastepaper, cardboard, and other consumable materials. Through efficient recycling processes, we aim to substantially decrease the volume of waste entering the recycling stream, reducing pounds of solid waste and saving gallons of water.

Modern printed materials are now designed with recyclability as a priority. Our customers increasingly choose ink and paper combinations that facilitate easier recycling. The use of water-based and vegetable-based inks, coupled with paper containing minimal coatings and additives, significantly enhances the recyclability of printed products. These inks are often water-miscible, making them easier to remove during the recycling process.

These combined efforts in sustainable sourcing and advanced recycling demonstrate the printing industry's holistic approach to environmental stewardship throughout the product lifecycle, from the paper and printing process to final recycling.

By combining these practices with our sustainable paper sourcing, efficient logistics, and recycling initiatives, we strive to offer a comprehensive approach to eco-friendly printing that helps protect the environment while meeting our clients' needs for high-quality print products.

**Additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a cornerstone of sustainable manufacturing, offering significant reductions in material waste and energy consumption compared to traditional methods.** This technology, also known as 3D printing, enables the production of complex geometries with minimal material usage, aligning with sustainability goals. For instance, Siemens has reported an 85% reduction in energy consumption and a 90% decrease in carbon footprint by integrating AM into its processes. Similarly, Vestas, a global leader in wind energy, uses AM to produce turbine components on-demand, reducing logistics emissions and material waste.

### Key Innovations in Sustainable Manufacturing:

1. **Additive Manufacturing (AM):**
   - **Material Efficiency:** AM minimizes waste by adding material layer by layer, unlike subtractive methods. For example, hollow infill structures in AM reduce material usage while maintaining structural integrity.
   - **Recycled Polymers:** The use of recycled materials, such as PLA and PETG, in AM has gained traction. These materials are biodegradable or recyclable, supporting circular economy principles. NatureWorks LLC, for instance, produces biopolymers like Ingeo, derived from renewable resources such as corn and starch, for 3D printing applications.
   - **Water Treatment Applications:** Oerlikon’s ceramic ink-based AM technology has demonstrated the ability to remove up to 75% of PFAS chemicals from water, showcasing its potential in environmental remediation.

2. **Water Management Strategies:**
   - **Closed-Loop Systems:** Industries are adopting closed-loop water systems to recycle and reuse wastewater. The Kalundborg Symbiosis in Denmark exemplifies this approach, where cascading water use among industries has been practiced for over 50 years.
   - **Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD):** Techniques like ZLD ensure that no wastewater is discharged into the environment. This method is increasingly used in sectors such as textiles and chemicals to reduce water pollution.

3. **Green Printing Processes:**
   - **Eco-Friendly Inks and Substrates:** Sustainable printing now incorporates soy-based and water-based inks, which are biodegradable and emit fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Companies like Kase Printing use these inks alongside recycled paper to minimize environmental impact.
   - **Digital Printing:** This method eliminates the need for printing plates, reducing waste and energy consumption. Digital workflows also optimize material usage, further enhancing sustainability.

### Case Study: Sustainable AM in Action
Transaera, a startup focused on sustainable air conditioning systems, leverages AM to prototype components with minimal waste. By using Markforged 3D printers, the company reduces material and energy usage, contributing to a lower carbon footprint. Similarly, Medtronic employs AM to optimize product designs, reducing material waste and extending product lifecycles.

### 1.1 Significance of biodegradable electronic materials

The increasing interest in sustainable, biodegradable electronic options is driven by the pressing need to address the environmental issues caused by e-waste and the reliance on non-renewable resources in the production of electronics [[10](/article/10.1007/s43939-025-00381-w#ref-CR10 ""Bhattacharjee J, De A, Kamila B, Mandal A.

In this regard, researchers are looking into different biodegradable materials, including lignocellulose scaffolds made from leaves, which provide a natural and sustainable option for stabilizing bio-sourced polymers in electronics [[12](/article/10.1007/s43939-025-00381-w#ref-CR12 ""Nair RR, Wolansky J, Uhlig K, Solgi A, Teuerle L, Zhang T, et al.

Recent developments in biodegradable materials have brought forth a range of exciting possibilities. Mycelium-based materials are attracting interest for their potential to upcycle agricultural waste and offer biodegradable substrates. However, there are still challenges to overcome in achieving uniformity and smoothness for thin-film applications [[13](/article/10.1007/s43939-025-00381-w#ref-CR13 ""Pruckner R, Holzinger L, Preninger D, Breitwieser M, Lehner L, Putz C, et al.

*From new consumer electronics to a shift towards better practices, here’s how the electronics manufacturing industry is pivoting towards sustainability.*

Electronic waste, extremely high levels of energy consumption, and a large carbon footprint—these are just some of what gives electronics and electronics manufacturing a bad rap when it comes to sustainability. Rather than pointing fingers and playing the blame game, industry leaders are taking on the challenge to make practices better for the environment. 

[Also Read: [Electronic Leaders Weigh In on Sustainability Challenges](https://www.global-imi.com/blog/electronics-leaders-weigh-sustainability-challenges)]

The electronics manufacturing industry is listening, and shifting to greener practices. This June 2024, researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders will be coming together for EGG, [Electronics Goes Green 2024+,](https://www.peacoc-h2020.eu/event/electronics-goes-green-2024/#:~:text=The%20Electronics%20Goes%20Green%202024,practices%20across%20the%20industry's%20value) a conference focusing on sustainability for the electronics and ICT industries. Plans, ideas, insights, and discoveries towards building more a sensitive and sustainable industry framework will be shared to steer electronics towards a greener path.

## **The Shift to “Next-generation” Sustainable Materials**

Forward-thinking electronics is doing away with components and materials that are difficult to recycle and are potentially hazardous or toxic to the environment. Today, researchers are exploring “next-generation” sustainable and biodegradable materials such as bioplastics. These are derived from organic resources and help reduce the carbon footprint. 

Chitosan, a type of sugar that comes from the exoskeletons of shellfish such as shrimps, lobsters, and crabs is one example of such an organic resource. It is conventionally used in the manufacture of medicines, but can potentially be used for electronics. 

Another example is [polylactic acid](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/alternative-energy/national-innovation-day-innovations-in-sustainable-electronics) (PLA), which is derived from fermented plant starch. PLA is becoming more recognized for electronic casing and other non-conductive components. 

Several inorganic resources can also be considered “green”. According to Electronic Specifier, aluminum is one of them because it is easily recyclable and has a very long lifespan. Other inorganic materials cited as being more “eco-friendly” are borosilicate glass and graphene, which are used in electronics. 

## **Miniaturization**

Miniaturization is one of the most vital innovations in sustainable electronics. EMS Now calls it “getting more for less space and materials, delivering portability, longevity, and energy efficiency gains.” 

Even consumers can make the observation that the smaller a gadget gets, the more powerful and “high-tech” it is. From our smartphones to kitchen gadgets, tiny devices can pack a lot of punch. Experts say that miniaturization improves energy storage and therefore makes smaller gadgets more energy efficient. 

## **Adopting Circularity and Encouraging Longevity of Use**

Electronic waste is a mounting problem, and the consumer drive to acquire the latest technology may be a contributing factor. Newer models come and go at lightning speed, enabling the disposal of many consumer electronics. 

On the other hand, some consumers make good use of the electronic devices they already have and are loathe to part with them, simply because getting newer devices is expensive. Some consumers will hang onto a computer long after its performance and capacity get slower and smaller. 

Perhaps there can be a middle ground. Sustainable electronics operate on principles such as “design for disassembly” (DfD) and “design for longevity”.

DfD’s objective is to make disassembly easy at the end of its life cycle, allowing consumers to make use of a device’s components or to repurpose them, for recycling. Meanwhile, design for longevity aims to make more durable products that last longer, are easy to repair, and are upgradable. 

These two principles make for better practices for electronics manufacture and consumption. Making devices last longer and easier to upgrade so consumers don’t have to keep replacing them requires a shift from the manufacturer’s side, but implementing it benefits the consumer in big ways. 

DfD and design for longevity stop enabling thoughtless disposal of electronic gadgets while optimizing a device long after its intended use and lifespan. 

## **Energy Efficiency**

When it comes to sustainability, energy efficiency is top of mind. Sustainable electronics focuses on energy-efficient innovations. When electronic devices are designed for energy efficiency, it contributes to their design for longevity, meaning consumers can use them for longer, and therefore also reduces their carbon footprint. 

How a device is powered also contributes to its efficiency. Wearable and portable devices are increasingly becoming thermal or solar-powered, which reduces dependency on plugging in for power or recharging, and at the same time extends the device’s battery life.

Sustainability in Electronic Components: Eco-Friendly Materials and Recycling Initiatives
=========================================================================================

Innovations in eco-friendly materials, closed-loop manufacturing, sustainable product design, and recycling systems offer a new vision for the future of electronics, writes K.A. Gerardino.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 4: Sustainability in Electronic Components: Eco-Friendly Materials and Recycling Initiatives](https://cdn.induportals-media-publishing.org/Press%20Files/09/62/13/96213-4.jpg)

 As global demand for electronic devices accelerates—driven by rapid advancements in consumer electronics, automotive technology, industrial automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT)—the environmental footprint of the electronics industry is drawing increased and justified scrutiny. The production of electronic components, from printed circuit boards (PCBs) and semiconductors to capacitors, resistors, connectors, and plastic housings, is resource-intensive and heavily reliant on processes that consume vast amounts of energy, water, and rare materials. These processes often involve hazardous substances, such as lead, mercury, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and toxic solvents, which pose significant risks to both human health and the environment.

 Compounding the issue is the industry’s continued dependence on a linear manufacturing model, where devices are designed for short-term use and are rarely built with reuse, repair, or recyclability in mind. As a result, mountains of electronic waste (e-waste) are generated every year—much of it ending up in landfills or informal recycling hubs, where it releases harmful pollutants and fails to recover valuable materials like gold, palladium, and rare earth elements. The United Nations estimates that over 62 million metric tonnes of e-waste were generated globally in 2023, a number expected to rise sharply unless significant reforms are adopted.

 Yet, in the face of these environmental challenges, a transformative shift is underway. Innovations in eco-friendly materials, closed-loop manufacturing, sustainable product design, and recycling systems are offering a new vision for the future of electronics—one that balances technological progress with environmental responsibility. From biodegradable PCB substrates and halogen-free laminates to circular design principles and urban mining technologies, stakeholders across the value chain are investing in more sustainable alternatives.

 This evolving landscape is being shaped not only by environmental necessity but also by regulatory pressure, consumer demand for greener products, and global initiatives aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The electronics sector—historically seen as a contributor to environmental degradation—is now at a pivotal point where it can become a catalyst for circular economy practices, leading the charge in decarbonizing industry, conserving resources, and reducing waste through innovation and accountability.

 As we delve deeper into the strategies and solutions being developed, it becomes clear that sustainability in electronic components is no longer a future aspiration—it is a present-day imperative with growing momentum across both industry and policy spheres.

**The Environmental Impact of Electronic Components** The environmental impact of electronic components is significant and multifaceted, spanning the entire lifecycle of a product—from raw material extraction and component manufacturing to product use and end-of-life disposal. Each stage presents its own set of ecological challenges, contributing to climate change, resource depletion, and pollution.

 One of the most pressing concerns is the use of hazardous substances in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs), which form the foundation of virtually all electronic devices. Traditional PCB production involves heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and mercury, as well as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These substances pose risks not only to human health during production and handling but also to ecosystems when devices are discarded improperly.

 Equally problematic is the semiconductor fabrication process, which is among the most resource-intensive sectors in the electronics industry. Semiconductor manufacturing requires enormous quantities of ultrapure water, energy, and toxic chemicals such as arsine, phosphine, and hydrofluoric acid. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), data centers and semiconductor fabs combined consumed over 2% of global electricity in 2023, with projections indicating continued growth as AI and high-performance computing demand increases. The carbon footprint of semiconductor production is particularly high in countries reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

 Meanwhile, the world's escalating dependence on digital devices—from smartphones and wearables to industrial control systems and electric vehicles—has led to an explosion of electronic waste (e-waste). The Global E-waste Monitor 2024 by UNITAR and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates that over 62 million metric tonnes of e-waste were generated worldwide in 2023. Shockingly, only about 17.4% of this was formally collected and recycled, and the trend is worsening. By 2030, the global collection and recycling rate is projected to drop to just 20%, primarily due to inadequate recycling infrastructure, lack of consumer awareness, and inconsistent regulatory enforcement in many regions.

 This uncollected e-waste often ends up in landfills or informal recycling hubs, especially in developing countries, where it poses severe health and environmental risks. Toxic substances from decomposing electronics can leach into groundwater or release carcinogenic dioxins during incineration. Informal recycling practices, such as open-air burning and acid baths used to extract metals, contribute heavily to air and soil pollution, impacting nearby communities and biodiversity.

 The environmental cost is also economic: according to the United Nations University (UNU), the raw materials embedded in e-waste—gold, platinum, palladium, copper, and rare earth elements—are worth over US$57 billion annually. Yet most of this value is lost due to poor recycling systems.

 In light of these challenges, there is a growing consensus among industry leaders, governments, and environmental organizations that a fundamental redesign of electronics manufacturing and distribution systems is urgently needed. This includes rethinking the materials used, minimizing resource consumption, and building robust infrastructure for collection, reuse, and safe recycling. It also involves embedding sustainability principles at the design stage, often referred to as “Design for Environment” (DfE), which includes strategies such as modular design for easy repair, use of biodegradable or recyclable materials, and reduction of component complexity.

 Additionally, initiatives like the European Union’s Green Deal, Right to Repair laws, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) frameworks are gaining traction globally. These regulatory frameworks are pushing manufacturers to take accountability for the full lifecycle of their products, encouraging eco-innovation and circular economy models.

 In summary, the environmental impact of electronic components is a critical concern that extends far beyond production. It encompasses systemic issues in energy use, toxic material handling, and waste management. Without decisive action and cross-sector collaboration, the industry risks exacerbating planetary boundaries. But with the integration of sustainable design principles, responsible sourcing, and effective recycling systems, there is a clear path forward—one that aligns technological progress with environmental protection.

![Image 5: Sustainability in Electronic Components: Eco-Friendly Materials and Recycling Initiatives](https://cdn.induportals-media-publishing.org/Press%20Files/09/62/13/96213-5.jpg)

**Sustainable PCB Manufacturing: Eco-Friendly Materials and Innovations** Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), the foundational elements of virtually all electronic devices, are among the most environmentally burdensome components due to their complex construction, intensive material requirements, and chemically harsh fabrication processes. Traditional PCBs typically consist of fiberglass-reinforced epoxy resins laminated with copper layers and treated with a host of chemicals during etching, plating, and cleaning. These steps often involve toxic heavy metals such as lead and chromium, halogenated flame retardants, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), all of which pose risks to workers and contribute to air, water, and soil pollution if not properly managed.

 While regulatory frameworks like the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and REACH directives have prompted the industry to transition away from some of the most dangerous substances, including lead and cadmium, challenges remain. The widely adopted lead-free solder alloys, such as tin-silver-copper (SAC), while less toxic, still depend on the extraction of finite resources like silver and copper—processes that involve significant energy use, habitat disruption, and environmental degradation. Furthermore, these alloys may suffer from thermal fatigue issues, especially in high-reliability applications, raising questions about their long-term durability and sustainability.

 In response, a new wave of research and innovation is reshaping the sustainability landscape of PCB manufacturing: 

*   **Bio-based PCB substrates** derived from cellulose, lignin, starch, and natural fiber composites are gaining attention for their biodegradability and renewability. Companies like Jiva Materials have developed commercially viable alternatives such as Soluboard, which dissolves in hot water, allowing for the easy recovery of components and materials without toxic processing. These materials can match traditional epoxy-based laminates in thermal and electrical performance for low-to-medium power applications, while drastically reducing end-of-life disposal issues.
*   **Green chemistry innovations** are replacing traditional toxic solvents and etching agents with water-based solutions, ionic liquids, and supercritical CO₂. These alternatives reduce worker exposure to harmful chemicals, cut down on wastewater treatment costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from volatile organic compounds.
*   **Additive manufacturing** (3D printing), though still emerging for PCBs, is enabling more sustainable production models by reducing substrate waste, shortening design-to-manufacture cycles, and enabling on-demand, local manufacturing. Materials such as conductive inks based on silver nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes allow for the printing of flexible, lightweight PCBs with reduced energy input and material consumption. Researchers are also exploring inkjet-printed biodegradable PCBs, which could be suitable for transient electronics, such as medical implants or disposable sensors.
*   **Embedded component technology** is helping reduce the number of discrete parts needed on a PCB, decreasing overall size and material usage. This design approach also improves electrical performance and thermal management, contributing indirectly to energy efficiency.
*   **Implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools** has become critical for evaluating the true environmental impact of PCB manufacturing. LCA helps identify carbon hotspots, water usage, and material inefficiencies throughout the value chain—from raw material extraction to end-of-life management—enabling manufacturers to optimize design and production decisions for minimal environmental harm.
*   Furthermore, **renewable energy integration** in PCB fabrication plants is emerging as a trend, with companies investing in solar panels, battery storage systems, and energy-efficient HVAC solutions to reduce Scope 2 emissions. For example, leading EMS providers in Europe and Japan have already begun reporting emissions reductions through such facility upgrades.

 In combination, these innovations represent a significant departure from the conventional PCB manufacturing model, offering new pathways to reduce toxicity, energy consumption, and waste. However, the adoption of sustainable PCB solutions is still uneven across the industry, with cost, performance trade-offs, and limited standardization posing hurdles to widespread implementation. Scaling these technologies—especially among small and mid-sized manufacturers—will require not only technological refinement but also policy support, supply chain incentives, and market demand for greener electronics. Nonetheless, the momentum is building, and sustainable PCB manufacturing is poised to play a pivotal role in the broader decarbonization and circularity of the electronics industry.

**Circular Manufacturing and End-of-Life Management** To further enhance sustainability in the electronics sector, the adoption of a circular manufacturing model is becoming an increasingly critical strategy. Unlike the traditional linear model of ""take, make, dispose,"" circular manufacturing seeks to maximize the lifecycle of materials through reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling—drastically reducing the demand for virgin raw materials and minimizing waste.

 In this model, Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and other components are designed with ease of disassembly in mind, allowing for the retrieval of valuable and finite resources such as gold, silver, copper, palladium, and rare earth elements. Design features like non-permanent adhesives, standardized fasteners, and layered modular assemblies make it easier to separate components at the end of a product’s life. This is especially vital as raw material prices soar and concerns grow over supply chain vulnerabilities and conflict minerals.

 Modular product design plays a central role in circularity. By allowing individual components—such as memory chips, sensors, batteries, and display units—to be upgraded or replaced independently, manufacturers can extend the useful life of a product without having to replace the entire system. Notable examples include the Fairphone, which enables users to swap out cameras, batteries, and processors with minimal tools, and Framework’s modular laptops, which are built entirely around repairability and upgradeability.

 Several companies and programs are already implementing circular practices: 

*   Apple uses disassembly robots like Daisy and Dave to recover components from returned devices and extract rare materials for reuse in new products. Apple also reuses materials such as recycled cobalt in batteries, reclaimed gold in logic boards, and recycled aluminium in enclosures.
*   Cisco launched a Takeback and Reuse Program which recovers old networking equipment from customers and reintroduces parts into new systems. In FY2023, Cisco reused or recycled nearly 99.9% of returned hardware by weight.
*   Dell operates one of the largest global electronics recycling programs and incorporates recycled plastics, carbon fiber, and rare earth magnets into new products. It also partners with recycling centers and NGOs in developing countries to create responsible e-waste infrastructure.
*   Panasonic and Sony have invested in facilities for closed-loop plastic recycling, enabling them to produce new devices using plastics reclaimed from older units, thereby cutting down both plastic waste and oil dependency.

Circular manufacturing also involves innovative recovery technologies. Methods such as cryogenic separation, laser ablation, chemical-free PCB depopulation, and bioleaching (using bacteria to extract metals from e-waste) are being explored to increase recovery efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

 Despite the promise, the

Relevant Content: to contribute to the achievement of a successful circular economy. This will significantly reduce CO2 emissions, water consumption and the use of non-renewable raw materials, for example. Further information.  Challenges and solutions The challenges in using recyclates are, on the one hand, consistent material quality and, on the other, security of supply. With the polyamide recyclate, Kärcher has succeeded for the first time in using a recycled material that has no loss in its property profile compared to the original material. In addition, it is industrial waste in large quantities, which makes it possible to use it in series production. [...] a ""neutral leverage effect"" is seen for goals 3, 13 and 15. Positive developments for climate protection in the context of plastic recyclates primarily follow from a functioning circular economy or resource efficiency and can only be considered in isolation from this to a limited extent. Therefore, only a neutral leverage effect is seen for SDG 13, even if the electrical and electronic industry has extensive technology contributions ready for a climate-neutral future. [...] Elena Spöri, Sustainability expert „Using recycled materials is essential for Kärcher to contribute to a functioning circular economy. In order to use recycled plastic successfully, it is particularly important to find the right recyclate for the corresponding requirements. Here, aspects such as stable processability, quality requirements or compliance with legal requirements often make the differeance.“ Sustainability Assessment With this project, Kärcher is coming a decisive step closer to its sustainability goal of noticeably increasing the use of recycled plastics. Nevertheless, we have not yet reached the end of this deve-lopment. We want to continue to push the use of recyclates in Kärcher products at full speed in order to contribute to the achievement of a successful circular

3 Foreword Dear members of the ZVEI, the use of recycled plastics is assessed as one of the core elements for a functioning circular economy, effective climate protection and the achievement of the (especially ecological) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations1. This paper discusses current challenges arising from an increased use of plastic recyclates2 and examines the environmental, economic and social sustainability of their use in electrical products. We also show what companies should look for when addressing the issue of plastic recyclates in practice.
The SDGs were selected for this sustainability assessment because they are a global framework that summarises the most important challenges of sustainable development and enjoys strong global support from governments and organisations of all kinds. In the context of the SDGs, goal 12 ""Sustainable Consumption and Production"" seems particularly relevant for the developments towards an increased use of plastic recyclates. With a growing world population and a parallel rise in living standards due to the increasing number of people moving up into the so-called middle class, there is an increasing material footprint per person on a global scale. Sub-goal 12.6 calls on governments to encourage companies to operate sustainably3. In a global survey, companies themselves give goal 12 the highest priority for implementation after goal 13 (climate protection). Urgent measures for the efficient use of resources and substantial reduction of waste are closely linked to this corporate opinion4.
The present results of the sustainability assessment cannot be a conclusive evaluation for practice, because the electrical industry is very heterogeneously positioned and the sustainability of recycled plastics in electrical products depends on many different parameters. Nevertheless, this publication provides initial assistance to facilitate entry into a complex subject area that is already of great importance to companies today. Four best-practice examples, which we have integrated at various points in this paper, show how companies in the electrical industry have experienced the topic of plastic recyclates to date. All examples have one thing in common: partnerships are indispensable to realise sustainable solutions in practice.
We wish you an exciting read!

For goals 7 (especially in the context of energy-efficient technologies), 8 (value creation, jobs), 9 (innovation, research), 12 (resource efficiency) and 17 (partnerships), a high leverage effect is possible through various measures. However, potential conflicts of objectives must also be taken into account, such as the partly unknown environmental / climate balance of recyclates currently available on the market. Therefore, a holistic assessment is always recommended.
In areas with comparatively low challenges (e.g. packaging or non-visible parts), companies should already be able to use recyclates today. The electrical industry can also support the sustainable use of recycled plastics through the targeted selection of primary plastics that can be processed into suitable recyclates at the end of their service life. However, increased use of recycled plastics is not yet holistically sustainable in many cases today and only contributes to the achievement of partial goals.
In order to clarify open questions and to overcome conflicting goals, especially around the improvement of availability and usability, a trialogue must be established between the manufacturers of plastics, the electrical industry as a user of plastics and the recycling industry. This paper is an impulse for such a trialogue. The ZVEI will work to ensure that events are held between the various stakeholders.

Among other things, new, binding requirements for the recycled content in products are to be developed in the area of plastics5.
Based on the first Circular Economy Action Plan (December 2015), a European Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy6 has already been adopted in 2018, addressing the untapped economic benefits of a more ""circular"" economy and the environmental impacts. Among other things, the strategy takes full account of recycling needs (alongside reuse and repair) and makes a concrete contribution to achieving the SDGs and meeting the Paris Climate Agreement. Annex III of the Plastics Strategy includes a call for stakeholders to commit to processing ten million tonnes of recycled plastics into new products for the EU market by 2025. To achieve these goals, the EU Commission has founded the Circular Plastics Alliance (CPA) (see infobox). Due to the long lifespan of electrical appliances, the CPA assumes that current changes in the design of electrical appliances will not yet have an impact on the political target in 20257.

i Circular Plastics Alliance (CPA): The stakeholder group, which was founded in September 2019 on the basis of a declaration, currently consists of over 250 organisations from industry, education and public institutions8. One working group is dedicated to Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and represents the electrical and electronics industry. The work of the CPA produced its first delivera-bles in 2020. Relevant contents are discussed at various points in the remainder of this paper9. 7 Society In public, plastics are mainly perceived as a problem of littering, i.e. the careless throwing away into the environment and oceans, although these plastics do not originate mainly from European latitudes.
Plastic products fragmented into small particles by multiple processes (""microplastics""11) are also a cause of concern for a growing proportion of society due to their occurrence in water and soil, not least because of the currently unknown consequences12.
Addressing these circumstances and concerns, the EU has most recently regulated, among others, certain single-use plastic products with Directive (EU) 2019/904 on reducing the impact on the environment13.
In addition, the plans for the implementation of the EU taxonomy show that it also very specifically addresses plastics production10. Under environmental goal 4, there are concrete demands, for example, for waste reduction and avoidance, for the reduction of the use of primary raw materials and the increased use of high-quality secondary raw materials. 10  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2020.198.01.0013.01.DEU, retrieved 22 February 2021 11  Microplastic is any solid plastic particle insoluble in water less than 5000 µm in length 12  https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/2020-11/Plastikatlas%202019%205.Auflage%20web.pdf?dimension1=ds_plastikatlas, retrieved 03 March 2021 13  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0904, retrieved 16 April 2021 8 Best practice examples from the electrical industry SLV GmbH Brief description of the product example When developing the SAMRINA outdoor luminaires, SLV GmbH had a clear goal: to replace as many primary raw materials as possible with secondary raw materials. For this reason, the ground spike luminaires are proportionately made of the plastic Schuladur® GF30 from LyondellBasell, which contains 35 percent recycled raw materials. In the total mass of the luminaires, the proportion of recycled material is 17 percent. At the same time, SAMRINA offers the quality and durability you are used to from SLV. Thus, it is a flexibly alignable ground spike luminaire, which makes in gardens, in front of homes, hotels and restaurants an equally sustainable, as stylish figure.
The central finding was: For sustainable business models, the use of secondary raw materials becomes unavoidable. To realize this requirement and to avoid bottlenecks, availabilities must be continuously checked. This requires consistent life cycle thinking and life cycle assessments in order to make more sustainable decisions through quantitative comparisons. Dr.-Ing. Pinar Erol, Head of Group Sustainability SLV Lighting Group „Developing and manufacturing sustainable products is a balancing act: In addition to using secondary raw materials – conserving resources, we make no compromises when it comes to quality, design and durability. With SAMRINA we have succeeded.“ Challenges and solutions The usual quality and safety standards must also be guaranteed with secondary raw materials. At the same time, customers want to benefit from a long service life and appealing aesthetics. From this point of view, it has become clear that the 100 percent use of recycled secondary raw materials is technically extremely demanding and not very effective. Thus, only a partial application is currently being considered, which can be further increased with technological progress.
Sustainability Assessment In line with the SLV Lighting Group strategy of increasing its own sustainability along the entire value chain and thinking consistently in terms of life cycles, replacing primary raw materials with secondary raw materials has a double effect: On the one hand, waste and residual materials can be fed into a functional circular economy and plastic waste accumulating in the environment can be reduced. On the other hand, the consumption of new raw materials is reduced, as these can be supplemented by secondary raw materials while maintaining the same product quality. 9 In Europe, about 62 million tonnes of plastic were produced in 2019, and demand from plastics converters was about 51 million tonnes. The electrical industry represents about 6.2 percent of this demand (Figure 3). A wide range of polymer types are used in electrical equipment (Figure 4).

Of this, 360 million tonnes was newly produced plastic (primary plastic). Processed recyclates were used in only 30 million tonnes of the total quantity produced. This corresponds to a share of 7.6 percent. However, a total of 50 million tonnes or 20 percent of the 250 million tonnes of plastic waste produced in the same period was recycled. The difference results from average process losses of 40 percent14.

The entire quantity of WEEE collected through official channels is treated properly and is thus available for recycling. A recent study shows that, in relation to the total amount of WEEE put on the market, 55 percent of WEEE is collected and officially reported17: • At least 20 percent of WEEE is in other streams (mixed with metal scrap, WEEE in bins, WEEE exported for reuse, illegal WEEE exports). • The study estimates the whereabouts of 25 percent as unknown (13 percent of the WEEE is not recorded. Approx. 12 percent is either also not recorded or there are uncertainties in the calculation method).
There are no data available to analyse the quality of treatment of WEEE collected by other, different actors. This naturally makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the materials contained in WEEE.

## Abstract

This study analyzes how policy mixes influence the transition to a circular plastics economy, focusing on recycling in the electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) sector. Our research contributes to the literature on how policy mixes can accelerate sustainability transitions by proposing an adjusted framework tailored to the circular economy transition. We use qualitative content analysis of 14 EU legislative documents and conduct 20 semi-structured interviews with actors across the plastics and EEE value chain. We find that the current policy mix is not conducive to promoting this transition and highlight three key barriers. First, we find short-term inconsistencies between increasing plastic recycling rates and tightening chemical regulations on hazardous substances. Second, we identify a lack of economic incentives to stimulate demand for recycled content and note the absence of harmonized, mandatory criteria for defining end-of-waste and recycled content. Finally, coordination between product users, producers, and recycling operators shows deficits.

Relevant Content: Mechanical recycling is one of the most widely used methods for processing plastic waste, allowing it to be reintroduced into the production cycle without significant chemical changes. This process involves sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting, and reprocessing plastics into new products [24]. Mechanical recycling can be closed-loop, where recycled plastics are turned into products of similar quality. It can also be an open-loop system if the plastic degrades and is repurposed into lower-value items [25]. A closed-loop recycling system refers to a process where a material is continuously recycled into the same or similar product without significant loss of quality. This system minimizes waste and reduces the need for virgin materials, making it a key component of a CE. For instance, [...] Take-back systems, on the other hand, place the responsibility on producers, retailers, or waste management companies to collect and properly manage plastic waste at the end of its life cycle [76]. These systems can be voluntary or mandatory, requiring manufacturers to provide collection points or reverse logistics systems for used plastic products. Take-back programs are widely used for electronic plastics, plastic packaging, and industrial plastic waste, ensuring that valuable materials are recovered and reintegrated into production cycles [76,77]. Some companies implement a closed-loop take-back approach, where plastics from returned products are directly reused in manufacturing new items, reducing reliance on virgin plastic production [66]. [...] plastic waste, converting hard-to-recycle plastics into raw materials [109]. Research into bioplastics and compostable alternatives is expanding, with some cities offering separate collections for compostable plastics [110]. The Packaging Act (VerpackG) makes producers responsible for waste collection and recycling. A Pfand system (bottle deposit refund) ensures high recovery rates for beverage containers (~98%) [111]. Electronics and batteries must be collected by retailers and manufacturers for recycling under Germany’s ElektroG law. Germany’s eco-design standards push for durable and repairable products, reducing electronic and plastic waste [112].

### **Abstract**

Plastic pollution has received worldwide attention due to its extensive environmental and health implications. The circular economy has emerged as a potential solution to plastic pollution. This overview comprehensively presents different plastic circular economy approaches and discusses their advantages, disadvantages, and implementation challenges. It highlights that the current plastic circular economy approaches primarily comprise mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, bio-based and biodegradable plastics, extended producer responsibility, deposit-refund schemes and take-back systems, design for circularity, and digital and smart waste management. Mechanical recycling is more well-established than chemical recycling but could downcycle plastic waste. Chemical recycling may facilitate the achievement of the closed-loop circular economy. Bio-based plastics can compete with food production and the biodegradable ones may require controlled composting conditions, though they come from renewable feedstocks. Extended producer responsibility promotes recycling and a shift toward sustainable materials but faces inadequate regulations and enforcement. Deposit-refund schemes and take-back systems are tied to extended producer responsibilities and depend on consumer awareness, infrastructure development, and regulatory enforcement. Design for circularity facilitates plastic reuse, recycling, and repurposing but is constrained by technology and cost. The digital and smart waste management approach improves the traceability and segregation of plastic waste but is limited by cost and digital infrastructure gap. In developing economies, the barriers to plastic circular economy implementation include economic constraints, technological challenges, expertise shortages, regulatory discrepancies, consumer habits, and a lack of infrastructural development. To overcome these barriers, the recommendations include supporting informal waste collection and its integration into the formal waste management system, public-private partnerships for investment, developing industrial composting facilities, enforcing clear labeling and disposal instructions, mandating extended producer responsibility, expanding collection points and accessibility, banning non-recyclable multi-layer plastics and developing artificial intelligence and blockchain for waste tracking.

### **1.** **Introduction**

Plastics have become an integral part of modern society, revolutionizing industries ranging from packaging and healthcare to construction and electronics. Their versatility, durability, and cost-effectiveness have driven exponential production growth, reaching approximately 460 million metric tons annually [**1**]. However, this widespread use has resulted in severe environmental consequences, including plastic pollution, resource depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions [**2**]. Currently, the costs linked to the external effects (on the economy, environment, and society) of plastics after their use are estimated conservatively at $3.7 trillion. This amount surpasses the entire profit margin of the plastic packaging industry [**3**]. If no measures are implemented, the lifetime cost associated with plastics is projected to increase twofold by 2040, reaching US $7.1 trillion. This amount represents 85% of the total global health expenditure in 2018 and exceeds the combined GDP of Germany, Canada, and Australia in 2019 [**3**].

Linear economic approaches, which follow a ""take-make-dispose"" strategy, have exacerbated these challenges by generating vast amounts of plastic waste with limited recycling or recovery. In response, the concept of a circular economy (CE) for plastics has gained traction as a sustainable alternative, emphasizing resource efficiency, waste minimization, and closed-loop material cycles [**4**]. Thus, there is a significant opportunity for the industry to embrace this new plastics economy [**5**]. This shift could improve socioeconomic outcomes throughout the supply chain while significantly minimizing plastic waste and reducing its harmful impact on the environment [**6**].

The CE is an economic model designed to decouple growth from resource consumption by promoting strategies such as reuse, repair, recycling, and remanufacturing [**7**]. In the context of plastics, CE aims to reduce environmental footprints while retaining material value within the economy [**8**]. Transitioning from a linear to a circular system necessitates innovative business models, policy interventions, technological advancements, and behavioral shifts [**9**]. Several CE approaches have been proposed to achieve these goals, including recycling-based approaches, bio-based plastics, extended producer responsibility (EPR), and digital solutions such as blockchain-enabled traceability [**10**,**11**,**12**].

Despite the increasing focus on CE principles, the implementation of CE for plastics remains inconsistent across regions and industries. Several challenges hinder the widespread adoption, including economic barriers, technological limitations, regulatory gaps, and consumer behavior [**13**]. Current global plastic recycling rates remain low, with only about 9% of plastic waste being recycled, while the rest is incinerated, landfilled, or leaked into the environment [**14**]. Additionally, the complexity of plastic compositions, contamination in waste streams, and inadequate infrastructure further complicate the transition to a fully circular system. Addressing these barriers requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates policy, industry, and scientific advancements [**15**].

Given the immense scale and complexity of the plastic pollution crisis, an overview that spans the breadth of CE approaches offers a more holistic and impactful contribution than narrowly focusing on a single strategy. Understanding the full landscape of CE strategies is critical to identifying synergies, gaps, and scalable solutions [**16**,**17**]. While deep dives into individual approaches can yield valuable technical insights, they often fail to capture the interconnected nature of the systems involved. In contrast, a broad overview enables cross-comparison of methods such as recycling, bio-based alternatives, extended producer responsibility, and digital tools, while highlighting how combinations of these strategies may be more effective across varying contexts [**18**]. This comprehensive lens is especially vital given the fragmented and uneven implementation of CE principles globally, and it allows for a more inclusive discussion of best practices, implementation barriers, and enabling conditions.

As such, this overview provides a comprehensive account of CE approaches for plastics, evaluating their effectiveness, challenges, and future potential. In contrast to existing reviews of the plastic CE that focus on limited approaches [**19**] or on practices specific to certain regions, like European countries [**20**], it explores a broader array of approaches globally, supported by cases of their implementation. Although existing reviews often emphasize particular enablers of the CE for plastic waste, such as consumer behavior and digitalization [**21**] or specific aspects like the value chain [**22**], this overview adopts a broader perspective by examining various plastic CE approaches without delving into specific components. By analyzing current research and emerging trends, this review aims to contribute to the discourse on sustainable plastic management and inform policymakers, businesses, and researchers on viable pathways toward a CE.

### **2. Literature Review** **Methods**

A systematic approach was employed in this comprehensive overview to identify, evaluate, and analyze relevant academic research on CE approaches for plastics. The methodology involved the following steps:

1. Search Strategy: A structured search was performed using academic databases comprising Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. Key terms included ""circular economy plastics,"" ""plastic recycling,"" ""sustainable plastic management,"" ""waste-to-resource strategies,"" and ""policy interventions in plastic waste management.""
2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Studies included in this study must be 1) academic articles, technical reports, and official publications from authorities and governments, 2) peer-reviewed, 2) published within the last decade, 3) related to the CE approaches for plastics, 4) related to the implementation of the plastic CE; and 5) linked to the barriers, challenges, advantages and disadvantages of the CE approaches. Articles that are constrained to specific technological, material, and engineering advances were excluded from the overview since the focus is on the overarching CE approaches. Similarly, articles that propose regulatory frameworks and policies are excluded, as this review concentrates on the implementation of plastic CE approaches.
3. Data Extraction and Categorization: Key themes were identified. The key themes here were the various plastic CE approaches. Studies were categorized to align with the article's thematic structure.
4. Critical Analysis and Synthesis: The selected literature was critically analyzed to identify trends, knowledge gaps, and conflicting perspectives. Particular attention was given to studies that provided efficiencies of the CE approaches and real-world case studies.

A flowchart summarizing the review process is shown in [Figure 1](#figure01).

**Figure 1** Flowchart illustrating the methodology of the literature review.

### **3. Approaches of Plastic CE**

The CE for plastics is a sustainable model aimed at eliminating plastic waste and pollution by designing materials for reuse, recycling, and regeneration. Unlike the traditional linear economy, which follows a ""take-make-dispose"" approach, the CE focuses on keeping plastics in circulation for as long as possible, reducing environmental impacts while maximizing resource efficiency [**4**]. This system relies on three key principles: eliminating unnecessary plastic waste, innovating for sustainable materials, and ensuring plastics are reused or recycled effectively [**23**].

The literature indicates that the main plastic CE approaches comprises 1) mechanical recycling approach that focuses on the collection, sorting, and reprocessing of plastic waste into new products [**24**,**25**]; 2) chemical recycling approach, which involves breaking down plastics into their molecular components through processes like pyrolysis, depolymerization, and gasification [**26**,**27**], 3) bio-based and biodegradable plastics approach, which promotes the development and use of plastics derived from renewable resources (e.g., plant-based polymers) and biodegradable alternatives to reduce environmental persistence [**28**,**29**], 4) EPR approach, mandating manufacturers to take responsibility for the end-of-life management of their plastic products, encouraging sustainable design, and improving waste management systems [**30**,**31**], 5) deposit-refund schemes and take-back systems, which incentivize consumers to return plastic products for proper recycling or reuse through financial incentives [**32**], 6) design for circularity approach, focusing on redesigning plastic products for longevity, reparability, and recyclability to minimize waste generation [**33**,**34**], and 7) digital and smart waste management approach, which utilizes digital technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven waste sorting, and Internet of Things (IoT) tracking systems to enhance traceability and efficiency in plastic waste management [**35**]. These approaches are discussed in further detail below.

### ***3.1*** ***Mechanical Recycling Approach***

Mechanical recycling is one of the most widely used methods for processing plastic waste, allowing it to be reintroduced into the production cycle without significant chemical changes. This process involves sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting, and reprocessing plastics into new products [**24**]. Mechanical recycling can be closed-loop, where recycled plastics are turned into products of similar quality. It can also be an open-loop system if the plastic degrades and is repurposed into lower-value items [**25**]. A closed-loop recycling system refers to a process where a material is continuously recycled into the same or similar product without significant loss of quality. This system minimizes waste and reduces the need for virgin materials, making it a key component of a CE. For instance, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles collected through recycling programs are cleaned, shredded, and reprocessed into new PET bottles [**36**]. An open-loop recycling system is a type of recycling process where waste materials are converted into new raw materials or products, but not necessarily into the same type of product they originated from. In this system, the recycled material may degrade in quality over time (downcycling) or be used in a different industry. For instance, in an open-loop system, plastic bottles are converted into polyester fibers used in textiles or carpets instead of being reprocessed into new bottles [**37**,**38**].

Mechanical recycling typically involves collection and sorting, during which waste materials collected from households, industries, or businesses are sorted manually or using automated systems, such as near-infrared sensors, air classifiers, or magnetic separators [**39**] ([Figure 2](#figure02)). Materials are separated by type, color, and polymer composition to improve recyclability. Subsequently, the materials are cleaned to remove contaminants like food residues, adhesives, labels, or other impurities that can affect quality. They are then shredded into smaller pieces to facilitate processing [**39**] ([Figure 2](#figure02)). The cleaned and shredded materials are melted at high temperatures to form pellets, flakes, or granules [**24**,**40**] ([Figure 2](#figure02)). Additives like stabilizers or colorants may be introduced to enhance their properties. The molten materials are then molded, extruded, or pressed into new products [**41**]. In a closed-loop system, the materials are used to manufacture similar items from which they are derived. In an open-loop system, the materials are processed into new products [**24**].

## 1 Introduction

Composite materials, often referred to as “composites,” consist of two or more constituent materials that exhibit significantly different physical or chemical properties. Within the final structure, these materials function in a synergistic manner to generate a material with superior properties in comparison to their individual components, ensuring that they remain distinct and separate [[1](/article/10.1007/s42452-025-06981-8#ref-CR1 ""Kozlowski RM, Muzyczek M, Walentowska J.

Table [1](/article/10.1007/s42452-025-06981-8#Tab1) illustrates common composite materials and their constituents. The primary components of a composite material are as follows:

As people become more aware of the damage that synthetic fibers like Kevlar and carbon fiber do to the environment, they become more interested in making bio-composites that are stronger with natural fibers like abaca, cotton, coir, and jute [[3](/article/10.1007/s42452-025-06981-8#ref-CR3 ""Kurien RA, Santhosh A, Paul D, Kurup GB, Reji GS, Selvaraj DP. A study on recent developments in jute, cotton, coir, silk and abaca fiber-reinforced composites. Adv Mater Process Manuf App Proc iCADMA. 2020;2021:375–84."")]. These natural fibers have different mechanical properties. For example, abaca has a high tensile strength, jute has a high Young's modulus, and silk has a higher elongation at break, which makes them useful for many situations. Researchers have pointed out that plant-based lignocellulosic fibers, like lemongrass and vetiver, are biodegradable, cost-effective, and easy to process. This makes them a good choice to replace synthetic composites [[4](/article/10.1007/s42452-025-06981-8#ref-CR4 ""Kurien RA, Koshy CP, Santhosh A, Kurup GB, Paul D, Reji GS.

However, they come with trade-offs in terms of how hard they are to process and how much they cost [[8](/article/10.1007/s42452-025-06981-8#ref-CR8 ""Kurien RA, Selvaraj DP, Sekar M, Koshy CP, Praveen KM.

Even with these positive developments, most of the current research is focused on specific types of fibers, their mechanical properties in certain situations, or ways to make them. Not many books put together a complete picture of how natural fiber composites have changed over time, how they affect the economy, how they are used, and how their life cycle is evaluated. This review seeks to address that gap by offering a comprehensive overview of eco-friendly composites from the perspectives of sustainability, performance, and processing while also emphasizing the necessity of standardization and future research avenues.

In numerous sectors, sustainability necessitates the utilization of environmentally favorable composites.

* *Kenaf* is a fast-growing plant that produces a high yield of fibers.

Natural fibers like jute, flax, hemp, and kenaf have very different mechanical properties. This is because of many different factors. The list includes environmental growth circumstances (including soil quality, climate, and harvesting season), the plant’s maturity stage during harvest, retting and extraction techniques, and any additional chemical or physical treatments administered to the fibers. Also, techniques like compression molding, vacuum infusion, and changing the fiber surface (for example, by treating it with alkali or silane) can have a big effect on how well the composite sticks to the matrix and how well it works overall. The values documented in the literature exhibit inherent variability, highlighting the necessity for consistency in testing and processing processes.

Various polymer matrices can employ these fibers to create composites specifically designed for specific applications. The structure of lignocellulosic fibers, which is mostly made up of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, is very important for controlling their mechanical properties, ability to break down, and how they interact with polymer matrices. Figure [1](/article/10.1007/s42452-025-06981-8#Fig1) shows a detailed view of these structural parts at both the cellular and molecular levels, offering helpful information for researchers involved in choosing fibers, treating them chemically, and designing composites.

Despite the growing interest in natural fiber-reinforced composites, the majority of current evaluations concentrate on discrete elements, such as mechanical performance, fiber treatment, or

## 1. Introduction

Natural fibers are renewable materials derived from plants, animals, or minerals, and have played a vital role throughout human history. Archaeological findings from Dzudzuana Cave in the Republic of Georgia suggest the use of flax fibers in textiles as early as 34,000 years ago [[1](#B1-fibers-13-00119)]. Later, from around 8000 B.C., records indicate the use of natural fibers for clothing in the Middle East and China, for pottery reinforcement in Central and South America by Inca and Mayan cultures [[2](#B2-fibers-13-00119)], and for the development of construction materials such as nets, ropes, and paper. Civilizations have used natural fibers through time to suit some of their needs, due to the sheer availability of natural fibers around the globe. In the 1930s, the creation of nylon made synthetic fibers an alternative to the natural ones because of their durability, waterproofing, and moisture resistance [[3](#B3-fibers-13-00119)]. During this time, consumer and customer preferences changed from natural fiber products to synthetic fiber products, which led to a rapid global decline in the production of natural fibers [[4](#B4-fibers-13-00119)]. Over the last century, natural fiber quality increased due to continuous research and technological advances, making them more affordable and desirable [[5](#B5-fibers-13-00119)], while synthetic fibers became less desirable due to specific disadvantages such as non-biodegradability, environmental persistence, and toxicity [[6](#B6-fibers-13-00119)].

Today, natural fibers are increasingly considered a sustainable alternative to non-renewable synthetic fibers due to their comparable properties, lower cost, abundance [[7](#B7-fibers-13-00119)], renewability, biodegradability, and low density [[8](#B8-fibers-13-00119)]. They are also generally regarded as safer for both human health and the environment, typically requiring no special handling precautions and having a lower carbon footprint compared to synthetic counterparts [[9](#B9-fibers-13-00119)]. However, while natural fibers are generally associated with low environmental impact, their carbon footprint can vary significantly depending on cultivation practices. Intensive use of agrochemicals, irrigation, and mechanized farming may increase energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, partially offsetting their sustainability advantages [[10](#B10-fibers-13-00119)]. Ongoing research continues to explore new sources of plant-based fibers from diverse botanical species and geographic regions to expand the potential of natural fiber applications.

The objective of this scoping review is to compile and synthesize information from key contributions in the field of natural fibers, namely with a primary focus on lignocellulosic

## Abstract

Breakthroughs in materials science are the driving force behind many of today's industrial advancements in our fast-changing high-tech world. Composite materials have proven valuable in numerous sectors, including automotive, aerospace, aeronautics, naval, and sports, due to their exceptional mechanical properties and lightweight nature. However, environmental concerns have led to a decrease in the use of fossil fuel-derived materials. Additionally, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel efficiency require lightweight materials with a lower carbon footprint, highlighting the importance of natural fiber composites. Natural fiber composites are made from renewable resources, comprising reinforcements made of natural fibers such as jute, flax, ramie, hemp, cotton, sisal, and kenaf, and a matrix, preferably derived from biomass, which may or may not be biodegradable. However, plant fibers have certain drawbacks when combined with polymers. Due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in lignocellulose, plant fibers are hydrophilic, making them incompatible with hydrophobic thermoplastics and prone to moisture damage. These limitations pose challenges for using plant fibers as polymer reinforcement. To improve adhesion between fibers and the polymer matrix and reduce moisture absorption, surface modifications are typically required. Various methods, such as alkaline, silane, or other chemical treatments, have been developed to enhance fiber-matrix compatibility and improve composite quality. Although natural fiber composites are still in development and their applications are limited, they hold great promise as a sustainable alternative to conventional materials.

Relevant Content: The problem of resorting to materials that cannot degrade under ambient “backyard” con-ditions, or even materials not industrially biodegradable altogether, is especially exacerbated in the design of interfaces with electronic components. To date, biodegradable electronics — both those that are backyard-degradable and those that are industrially biodegradable — cannot compete performance-wise with their conventional counterparts. As a result, a second issue emerges: although designers are progressively experimenting with eco-friendly materials, “smart” and responsive systems still largely rely on embedding discrete, non-renewable electronics parts, such as integrated circuits and passive electronic components. [...] However, as discussed in Chapter 1, it is not possible to make certain high-speed or precise electronic systems with degradable materials, nor is it necessarily desirable to have every electronic system degrade quickly. Nonetheless, there exists a space of “semi-permanent” technological design that biological, backyard-degradable materials are well-suited for. For example, packaging for food, cosmetics, and other goods is one application area that demands both reusability and responsible disposability, and this is the focus application of this chap-ter. Increasingly eco-conscious consumers wish to be able to reuse packaging when possible, but packaging inevitably becomes soiled or worn beyond recovery, or it simply becomes overly burdensome to carry in certain on-the-go situations. At the [...] Sustainability often remains a secondary consideration brought about late in a design process, and an unspoken assumption is that a sustainable material must approximate the material properties of its conventional counterpart to be a competitive choice. As a result, many of the materials labeled as “bio-based,” “biodegradable,” and “compostable” that are available on the market today have been heavily processed from their natural constituents and speciﬁcally developed to match the durability and other material properties of con-ventional, non-sustainable materials. Several commercially available prototyping materials, such as polylactic acid (PLA), the most popular ﬁlament for 3D printing and one featured in 25% of physical prototyping papers at CHI, are marketed as “eco-friendly,” yet

Backyard-Degradable Interactive Electronics by Katherine Wei Song A dissertation submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and the Designated Emphasis in New Media in the Graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley Committee in charge: Professor Eric Paulos, Chair Professor Bj¨ orn Hartmann Professor Kimiko Ryokai Summer 2024 Backyard-Degradable Interactive Electronics Copyright 2024 by Katherine Wei Song 1 Abstract Backyard-Degradable Interactive Electronics by Katherine Wei Song Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and the Designated Emphasis in New Media University of California, Berkeley Professor Eric Paulos, Chair As the demand for material goods increases, waste is accumulating on our planet at an alarming rate. Electronics in particular present signiﬁcant sustainability challenges due to the energy-intensive processes involved in their production and their dependence on nonre-newable resources. Unwanted and broken devices often end up in landﬁlls, where they do not decompose. There has been much progress across disciplines in inventing electronics with biodegradable and compostable parts, but still, sustainability and functionality are largely at odds with one another, and systems to date still rely on standard electronic components that pose recycling and disposal challenges at end of life. Additionally, the pursuit of new sustainable technologies remains a specialized domain out of reach for the non-expert “ev-eryday maker.” This not only sidelines the needs and aspirations of already-marginalized communities but also overlooks potential avenues for the development of novel systems. My research, which operates at the intersection of interactive computing, engineering, materials science, and design, envisions the creation of “backyard-degradable interactive electronics”: a class of future sustainable electronics whose entire lifecycle — from initial material sourcing to the eventual return to the earth — is a creative process that invites mass participation at every stage. This thesis o↵ers three main contributions. I detail two strategies for mak-ing such backyard-degradable interactive electronics: (1) a materials-centric approach for creating backyard-degradable electronic components that can come together to form standalone backyard-degradable electronics, and (2) a systems-level approach whereby a backyard-degradable module can be wirelessly activated and powered by conventional non-degradable energy transmitters that are already ubiquitous. Through the presentation of example systems made with these approaches, I show that backyard-degradability applied as a constraint is a constructive practice, opening up doors for new aesthetics and interac-2 tions in new domains. (3) Finally, I present material considerations, fabrication strategies, and a generalizable framework for designing for unmaking, an overlooked but important extension to making that is uplifted by the practice of designing with backyard-degradable materials.

# Beyond FR 4: Exploring Biodegradable PCB Substrates for Eco Friendly Electronics

Author : Colby September 01, 2025

---

 

In the fast-evolving world of electronics, sustainability is no longer just a buzzword—it’s a necessity. Traditional PCB materials like FR-4 have long been the industry standard due to their durability and performance. However, their environmental impact, including non-biodegradability and toxic waste, has pushed the industry to seek greener alternatives. Biodegradable PCB substrates and alternative materials are emerging as promising solutions for eco-friendly PCB design and sustainable PCB manufacturing. In this blog, we’ll dive deep into why moving beyond FR-4 matters, explore innovative FR-4 alternatives, and highlight how these materials are shaping the future of electronics.

## Why Move Beyond FR-4 for Sustainable PCB Manufacturing?

FR-4, a composite material made of woven fiberglass and epoxy resin, has been the backbone of printed circuit boards (PCBs) for decades. It offers excellent thermal stability, mechanical strength, and electrical insulation, making it ideal for a wide range of applications. However, its environmental drawbacks are hard to ignore. FR-4 is not biodegradable, meaning it contributes significantly to electronic waste (e-waste), which is growing at an alarming rate. According to the Global E-waste Monitor, the world generated 62 million metric tons of e-waste in 2022, with only a fraction being recycled properly.

Additionally, the production of FR-4 often involves halogenated flame retardants, which can release toxic substances during manufacturing or disposal. These factors have driven the need for alternative PCB materials that align with eco-friendly PCB design principles. Biodegradable PCB substrates offer a way to reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance, making them a key focus for sustainable PCB manufacturing.

## What Are Biodegradable PCB Substrates?

Biodegradable PCB substrates are materials designed to break down naturally over time, reducing the long-term environmental footprint of electronics. Unlike FR-4, which persists in landfills for centuries, these substrates can decompose through biological processes, often leaving behind minimal or non-toxic residue. They are typically made from natural or bio-based materials such as plant fibers, cellulose, or biopolymers, which are renewable and less harmful to the environment.

One standout example in the industry is a fully recyclable PCB substrate that uses water-soluble materials. This innovation allows the board to dissolve in water, leaving behind components that can be reused or recycled. Such advancements not only tackle e-waste but also support a circular economy by enabling material recovery. Studies have shown that adopting biodegradable substrates can reduce carbon emissions during disposal by up to 60%, a significant step toward net-zero goals.

While performance is a concern with biodegradable materials, ongoing research is improving their thermal and mechanical properties to match or approach those of traditional materials. For instance, some biodegradable substrates now achieve dielectric constants similar to FR-4 (around 4.5 at 1 MHz), ensuring they can handle signal integrity for many applications.

## Key Benefits of Biodegradable PCB Substrates for Eco-Friendly PCB Design

Switching to biodegradable PCB substrates offers multiple advantages for manufacturers and the environment. Here are some of the most impactful benefits:

* **Reduced E-Waste:** With e-waste becoming a global crisis, biodegradable materials help minimize landfill contributions by breaking down naturally. This is especially crucial for short-lifecycle devices like disposable sensors or single-use medical electronics.
* **Lower Carbon Footprint:** The production and disposal of biodegradable substrates often emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to traditional materials. This aligns with global efforts to achieve sustainability in electronics manufacturing.
* **Biocompatibility:** For applications like wearable or implantable medical devices, biodegradable substrates are often more compatible with the human body, reducing risks associated with long-term exposure.
* **Support for Circular Economy:** Many biodegradable and recyclable substrates allow for component recovery, enabling reuse and reducing the need for raw material extraction.

These benefits make biodegradable PCB substrates a compelling choice for industries aiming to adopt eco-friendly PCB design practices while meeting consumer demand for sustainable products.

## Alternative PCB Materials as FR-4 Alternatives

Beyond biodegradable substrates, several alternative PCB materials are gaining traction as FR-4 alternatives. These materials prioritize sustainability without compromising performance. Let’s explore some of the most promising options:

### 1. Plant-Based Fibers and Composites

Plant-based fibers, such as flax or hemp, are being used to create composite materials for PCB substrates. These fibers replace the fiberglass in FR-4, offering a renewable and biodegradable base. While they may not yet match FR-4’s mechanical strength (typically around 300 MPa tensile strength for FR-4), they are suitable for low-stress applications like consumer electronics. Their dielectric properties, often around 3.5 to 4.0 at 1 MHz, also support adequate signal performance for many designs.

### 2. Halogen-Free Polymers

Halogen-free polymers are another eco-friendly alternative that eliminates the toxic flame retardants found in traditional FR-4. These materials maintain good thermal stability (up to 130°C) and electrical insulation, making them viable for a range of applications. They are not always biodegradable but are a step toward safer manufacturing and disposal processes.

### 3. Cellulose-Based Materials

Cellulose, derived from wood pulp or other plant sources, is being explored as a biodegradable substrate. Recent innovations have improved its structural integrity, with some cellulose-based boards achieving thermal conductivity comparable to FR-4 (around 0.25 W/mK). These materials are particularly promising for flexible electronics, such as wearable devices.

## Challenges in Adopting Biodegradable and Alternative PCB Materials

While the potential of biodegradable PCB substrates and other FR-4 alternatives is undeniable, several challenges remain in their widespread adoption for sustainable PCB manufacturing. Understanding these hurdles is key to appreciating the current state of the technology and its future trajectory.

* **Performance Limitations:** Many biodegradable materials struggle to match FR-4’s thermal resistance (up to 140°C) and mechanical durability. For high-performance applications like aerospace or automotive electronics, these alternatives may not yet be suitable.
* **Cost of Production:** Developing and processing biodegradable substrates can be more expensive than traditional materials. Scaling up production and optimizing manufacturing processes are essential to make these options cost-competitive.
* **Manufacturing Compatibility:** Current PCB fabrication equipment and processes are optimized for FR-4. Adapting to new materials may require significant investment in tooling and training.
* **Limited Availability:** Biodegradable and alternative materials are not yet widely available in the market, which can slow down adoption by smaller manufacturers or startups.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research and industry collaboration are steadily addressing these issues, paving the way for broader use of eco-friendly materials in electronics.

## Applications of Biodegradable PCB Substrates in Modern Electronics

Biodegradable PCB substrates are finding their place in various innovative applications, particularly where sustainability and short-term use are priorities. Here are some key areas where they are making an impact:

* **Wearable Electronics:** Devices like fitness trackers and smart clothing benefit from flexible, biodegradable materials that reduce environmental impact after disposal.
* **Medical Devices:** Implantable devices such as pacemakers or temporary sensors can use biocompatible substrates that degrade harmlessly in the body, eliminating the need for surgical removal.
* **Disposable Electronics:** Single-use sensors for environmental monitoring or medical diagnostics are ideal candidates for biodegradable PCBs, as they minimize waste in high-turnover applications.

These applications highlight the versatility of biodegradable materials and their potential to transform eco-friendly PCB design across industries.

## The Future of Sustainable PCB Manufacturing

The shift toward biodegradable PCB substrates and alternative PCB materials is just the beginning of a larger movement in sustainable PCB manufacturing. As technology advances, we can expect several trends to shape the future:

* **Improved Material Properties:** Research is focused on enhancing the thermal, mechanical, and electrical performance of biodegradable substrates to rival or exceed FR-4. For example, achieving dielectric constants closer to 4.5 and thermal stability above 150°C could open up high-end applications.

Raw Content: # Recycling Critical Materials from E-Waste for a Circular Economy

***Recycling critical materials in e-waste can minimize the environmental impact at the end of a product's life but also reduce the demand for raw materials.***

**3ds.com, Mar. 24, 2025** –

As stated in the global [E-waste Monitor 2024,](https://ewastemonitor.info/the-global-e-waste-monitor-2024/) annual global e-waste (or electronic waste) generation nearly doubled between 2010 and 2022, rising from 34 million tons to 62 million tons. Half of this total consists of metals and critical materials, while the remaining portion is made up of plastics (27%) and materials like glass and composites (23%). Far from decreasing, the amount of e-waste is projected to reach 82 million tons by 2030.

This is a major concern due to the devastating impact e-waste can have on  [the environment and the human health](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/electronic-waste-(e-waste)), particularly from the release of toxic pollutants that contaminate air, soil, and water. In countries like Ghana, where [e-waste recovery is often done informally](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/least-developed-countries-sustainable-ewaste-management/), local populations are exposed to hazardous chemaicals while dismantling electronic waste. The lack of protective measures and poor working conditions puts workers, often from impoverished communities, at severe health risk. Despite attempts to formalize recycling efforts, the industry remains largely unregulated, leaving vulnerable populations to bear the environmental and social consequences.

Recovering and recycling e-waste is a key solution. The good news: not only it can minimize the environmental impact at the end of a product's life but also from the outset by reducing the demand for raw materials. Thus, the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary) estimates that ""recycled quantities of copper and cobalt could reduce 2040 primary supply requirements by 30%, and 15% for lithium and nickel"".

**Recovering electronics to recycle critical materials**

In that context, prioritizing recovery and recycling of critical materials contained in the large amount of e-waste is key. Because, while [critical materials](https://www.3ds.com/sustainability/critical-materials-value-network) are essential for advancing clean energy technologies – including renewable energy systems and electric vehicles – as well as driving digital transformation, the risks of supply chain disruptions are high. This vulnerability is due to geographic concentration, limited substitutes, and the finite nature of these resources.

Following circular economy principles which foster waste reduction, recycling and reuse, elements such as cobalt, nickel, copper and Rare Earth Elements (REEs) could be recovered from e-waste, re-processed and put back into the next generation of high-performance electronics, lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, circuit boards, and other electronic components.

**The role of regulations in curbing the environmental and social impacts of e-waste**

Regulations and frameworks are essential in shaping a sound management of e-waste and the recovery of critical materials. For example, when there is a lack of formal recycling infrastructure, e-waste can be handled through informal channels, exposing workers to hazardous substances like lead and mercury without proper safety measures.

The **Sustainable Development Goals** (SDGs), adopted in 2015, offer a broad framework for addressing these challenges. More specifically, SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) emphasizes sustainable resource management and waste reduction, while SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) promotes innovation in e-waste recycling technologies and resource recovery systems.

**A Global Perspective on regulations**

Globally, various legislations are regulating e-waste. The **Basel Convention**, an international treaty, aims to control the transboundary movement of hazardous waste, including e-waste, and ensure environmentally sound disposal. In the United States, the **National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship** focuses on improving e-waste recycling infrastructure and responsible material recovery. Meanwhile, China's **Extended Producer Responsibility** (EPR) policies mandate electronics manufacturers to take responsibility for end-of-life product management. Additionally, specific legislation in the European Union, such as the **Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive** (WEEE Directive), mandates the separate collection, treatment, and recycling of e-waste, as well as setting collection and recycling targets. Finally, the **Critical Raw Materials Act** aims to reduce the EU's dependence on imported critical materials by creating a resilient and sustainable supply chain, with a recycling target of 25% by 2030.

While mandates like EPR establish responsibility, financial mechanisms such as tax reductions for recycled material usage, subsidies for advanced recycling technologies, and funding for research in sustainable material alternatives can accelerate adoption. Encouraging private sector investment in e-waste recycling infrastructure and material recovery technologies is also essential to bridging the gap between regulation and implementation.

Despite these initiatives, significant gaps remain: globally, only [81 countries](https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling) have enacted e-waste legislation or initiatives, and fewer still–46 countries–have established formal collection targets, while just 36 countries have set recycling targets. This underscores the urgent need for stronger enforcement and better alignment of national and regional efforts with global sustainability goals.

Making recycling a reality through circular economy principles

Circularity promotes the recovery, recycling, and reuse of e-waste by encouraging electronic manufacturers to adopt closed-loop systems. These systems can be supported by using mono-materials and modular designs, both of which simplify disassembly and enhance recycling efficiency, as well as integrating recycled materials into new devices.

**Innovation in recycling technology**

However, challenges remain. First of all, recovery and recycling of e-waste needs to be more efficient and economically viable. Indeed, many products combine materials that are difficult to separate, and the low recovery value of some critical materials reduces the economic incentive for recycling. To address these issues, innovations in recycling technologies have emerged, improving the efficiency, precision and profitability of material recovery from e-waste.

Key processes in material recovery include dismantling, the foundational step to separate critical material-rich components from devices and isolate recyclable parts. Chemical processing plays a crucial role in extracting materials from e-waste by isolating valuable elements from non-recyclable or hazardous components. Additionally, biotechnology offers a sustainable solution for critical materials recovery through bioleaching, a process that uses microorganisms to extract materials, further enhancing recovery methods. Beyond processes, investing in efficient collection and sorting infrastructure can increase the volume and quality of recycled e-waste.

Improving the recovery and recycling of critical materials in e-waste can in turn create new business opportunities by fostering the growth of specialized recycling companies and enabling the production of secondary raw materials. Companies can capitalize on sustainable supply chains, offering eco-friendly electronics made from recycled components, while startups can explore advanced sorting, refining, and remanufacturing techniques. Additionally, the circular economy model can drive collaborations between manufacturers, recyclers, and policymakers, leading to new markets for refurbished electronics, closed-loop production systems, and sustainable product design services.

**Leveraging virtual twins to improve recycling processes**

Thanks to the Virtual Twin technology, electronics manufacturers can improve recycling processes by modeling complex material value chains, optimizing recycling pathways and implementing data-driven decisions. Virtual Twin Experiences enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders, improve resource utilization, and enhance sustainability in operations.

**Handling e-waste at its root: Reducing Reliance on Critical Materials Through Eco-Design**

By rethinking product design, electronics manufacturers can address critical materials dependency and reduce e-waste right from the start. One effective way to do just that is through [eco-design](https://www.3ds.com/sustainability/circular-economy/eco-design), an approach that integrates sustainability principles into product development to minimize waste and environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle. Dassault Systèmes' lifecycle assessment (LCA) solutions enable manufacturers to implement eco-design principles.

By implementing [lifecycle assessment](https://www.3ds.com/sustainability/circular-economy/eco-design/lifecycle-assessment), manufacturers can address the e-waste issue at its root by:

* **Design for Durability:**  Extending the useful life of products through robust components and modular designs reduces the frequency of replacements, thereby curbing waste generation. Longer-lasting electronics mean fewer discarded devices and lower demand for new materials or devices
* **Design for Reparability:** Simplifying products, standardizing components and providing repair manuals enable consumers and technicians to fix and upgrade products with ease. Additionally, modular designs significantly reduce critical raw material consumption over time by enabling the replacement of individual parts instead of entire devices.
* **Design for Disassembly:**  Ensuring that electronic equipment can be easily disassembled at the end of their lifecycle facilitates waste processing, efficient recovery and recycling of valuable materials. Thoughtful design choices make material separation simpler and more effective
* **Integrating recycled materials:**  Incorporating recycled critical materials into new electronic devices helps lower environmental impact, reduce costs, and support circularity. By investing in recycling technologies, manufacturers can recover critical materials from e-waste with higher purity and efficiency. Additionally, establishing industry standards for the use of recycled materials ensures consistent quality and reliability

**Material Innovation: Exploring Sustainable Alternatives**

Beyond redesigning products, material innovation is another way we can reduce critical materials dependency from the start. Research into bio-based materials and synthetic substitutes for rare earth elements can provide viable alternatives for electronic applications. For example, graphene is being explored as a potential replacement for certain conductive materials, while new alloys seek to reduce reliance on scarce elements without compromising performance.

Innovations in material processing, such as additive manufacturing, allow for precise material usage, minimizing waste and critical materials consumption.

Dassault Systèmes empowers manufacturers to significantly reduce electronic waste and develop more sustainable electronics through its collaborative **3D**EXPERIENCE platform and advanced simulation capabilities. By fostering collaboration across the value chain, Dassault Systèmes connects manufacturers with recyclers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to build efficient circular and low-emissions supply chains that enhance material recovery rates and minimize hazardous waste.

Dassault Systèmes enables virtual prototyping, allowing manufacturers to create and test products digitally before physical production. This reduces waste, optimizes material usage, and enhances product sustainability. The Virtual Twin technology further supports e-waste reduction by:

* **Streamlining Manufacturing:**  Identifying inefficiencies in production processes to minimize material waste
* **Optimizing Recycling Processes:**  Simulating material recovery scenarios to improve efficiency and reduce costs
* **Enhancing Repair and Maintenance:**  Providing data-driven insights for designing products with better repairability and serviceability

Dassault Systèmes' commitment to circularity is also evident in its leadership role in the EECONE (European ECOsystem for greeN Electronics) project. By spearheading the creation of a comprehensive knowledge hub, Dassault Systèmes ensures that all stakeholders have access to essential resources such as eco-design tools, metrics, databases, and guidelines. This fosters collaboration and accelerates the adoption of sustainable practices across the electronics industry.

## Basic Information about Electronics Stewardship

### Sustainable Approaches for Every Stage of the Electronics Life Cycle

Sustainably managing electronics by reducing the amount of materials used, increasing reuse, refurbishing and extending the life of products, and recycling electronics can help reduce the amount of waste that needs to be managed domestically and globally. Examining a product’s entire life cycle can uncover new opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources, and reduce costs.

The graphic below shows each life cycle stage, which are described in more depth under the graphic. Some electronics manufacturers have adopted innovative approaches to ensure electronic products are sustainably sourced, designed, and managed throughout their life cycles. The companies mentioned here have received awards from EPA’s Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) Electronics Challenge for these practices.

### A circular life cycle of electronic products includes the following stages:

#### Sourcing Materials

Materials such as iron, gold, aluminum, palladium, platinum, lithium, copper, and plastics play crucial roles in the high-tech electronics products that affect our daily lives. These materials are extracted from the earth, transported, processed, refined, and incorporated into products. These activities use large amounts of energy and produce greenhouse gas emissions, pollute the environment, and deplete our natural resources. Reducing materials can save natural resources, conserve energy, and reduce pollution.

#### Product Design and Manufacturing

Designing and manufacturing electronics with the environment in mind is critical for developing more sustainable products. Source reduction, also known as waste prevention, is important in design and manufacturing, as electronics that have less impact on human health and the environment often use less materials overall, use more recycled materials, are more durable, and are recyclable.

#### Product Procurement and Use

A first step in using electronics sustainably involves educating consumers about sustainable purchasing choices. Learn about innovative approaches for product procurement and use.

Manufacturers have a responsibility to create durable, long-lasting, reusable, and recyclable products, but consumers also play a significant role in maintaining their electronics.

#### Collection

Community drop-off points, certain retailers, and manufacturers through mail-in, take-back, and warranty programs collect electronics. These collection entities either send reusable electronics to recovery facilities to be reused, refurbished, and resold, or to recycling facilities to be sorted, cleaned, and processed into materials that can be used again in manufacturing. After collection, reusable electronics are refurbished and resold, and recyclables are sent to recycling facilities to be sorted, cleaned, and processed into materials that can be used again in manufacturing.

#### Reuse and Refurbishing

Refurbished electronics are electronics that have been updated and repaired for resale. Reusing electronics extends product life spans and contributes to the source reduction of raw materials.

#### Recycling

Recycling includes sorting, dismantling, mechanically separating, and recovering valuable materials. Recycling used electronics can yield materials (e.g., gold, copper, glass, aluminum) that can be returned to the supply chain to be reused, reducing raw materials used and the need for disposal of the used electronics.

### Sustainable Electronics Management

Electronic devices and technologies continue to advance and increase in number. These technologies have become critical to our way of life and to our growing economy. With these technologies, however, comes the increasing challenge of protecting human health and the environment from the potentially harmful effects associated with their improper handling and disposal.

A long-term sustainable approach towards electronics stewardship is necessary both at work and at home. With the prevalence of electronics in mind, the federal government is committed to being a responsible consumer of electronics and a leader of electronics stewardship in the United States. Sustainable electronics management involves the following practices:

#### Reusing and donating electronics

Preventing waste in the first place is preferable to any waste management option, including recycling. Donating used (but still operating) electronics for reuse extends the lives of valuable products and keeps them out of the waste stream for a longer period of time.

#### Recycling electronics

If donation for reuse or repair is not a viable option, households and business can send their used electronics for recycling.

#### Buying green

Environmentally responsible electronics use involves not only proper end-of-life disposition of obsolete equipment, but also purchasing new equipment that has been designed with environmentally preferable attributes.

### Benefits of Electronics Stewardship

Increasing sustainable electronics management efforts can create green jobs, lead to more productive reuse of valuable materials, increase the value of American exports, and support a vibrant American recycling and refurbishing industry. If done properly, the United States can increase its domestic recycling efforts, reduce harm from exports of electronics waste (e-waste) being handled unsafely in developing countries, strengthen domestic and international markets for viable and functional used electronic products, and prevent health and environmental threats at home and abroad.

Recycling electronics helps reduce pollution that would be generated while manufacturing a new product and the need to extract valuable and limited virgin resources. Electronic recycling also reduces the energy used in new product manufacturing.

Donating electronics allows schools, nonprofit organizations and lower-income families to obtain equipment that they otherwise could not afford. Businesses can also take advantage of tax incentives for donated computer equipment.

Green electronics contain fewer toxic constituents. The use of recycled materials in new products promotes the following benefits:

* More energy efficient (e.g., showing the [Energy Star](http://www.energystar.gov/) label).
* More easily upgraded or disassembled.
* Use minimal packaging.
* Offers leasing or takeback options.
* Meets performance criteria and shows they are more environmentally preferable.

### Regulations for Electronics Stewardship

#### Rules for Managing Cathode Ray Tubes

A cathode ray tube (CRT) is the glass video display component of an electronic device, usually a computer or television monitor. CRT funnel glass generally contains high enough concentrations of lead that the glass is regulated as hazardous waste when disposed. CRTs and CRT glass were once easily recycled into new CRTs, however, the demand for new CRTs has collapsed in favor of new flat panel technologies. Because of rising costs, negative economic incentives and shifts in CRT glass markets, some CRT processors and recyclers are choosing to store the glass indefinitely rather than send it for recycling or disposal, which increases the risk of mismanagement and/or abandonment of CRTs.

In 2006, EPA amended its regulations to streamline management requirements for recycling of used CRTs and glass removed from CRTs. The amendments excluded these materials from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act definition of solid waste, if certain conditions are met (see [title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations in Section 261.4(a)(22)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt40.26.261#se40.26.261_14)). On June 18, 2014, EPA finalized revisions to the export provisions of the 2006 CRT final rule. These changes allow the Agency to obtain additional information to better track exports of CRTs for reuse and recycling in order to ensure safe management of these materials.

[Find out more](/hw/cathode-ray-tubes-crts) about EPA's CRT regulations, including information on the 2014 final rule.

### Assessment Tools for Electronics Stewardship

#### Electronics Environmental Benefits Calculator

The downloadable [Electronics Environmental Benefits Calculator (EEBC)](/fec/publications-and-resources#calculator) (last bullet titled ""Benefits Calculator"") estimates the environmental benefits of improving the purchasing, use and disposal of computer products; specifically computer desktops, liquid crystal display (LCD) and cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors and computer notebooks/laptops. The EEBC also calculates the benefits of mobile phone reuse and recycling, and of recycling mixed loads of electronic equipment. [Find out more](/fec/using-electronics-environmental-benefits-calculator-eebc-7252012) information about using the EEBC.

#### Waste Reduction Model

EPA created the [Waste Reduction Model](/waste-reduction-model) to help solid waste planners and organizations track and voluntarily report greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy savings from several different waste management practices, including sustainable electronics management.

#### Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)

The [Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)](/greenerproducts/electronic-product-environmental-assessment-tool-epeat) is a procurement tool created to help institutional purchasers in the public and private sectors evaluate, compare, and select desktop computers, notebooks, and monitors based on their environmental attributes. EPEAT also provides a clear and consistent performance criteria for product design and provides an opportunity for manufacturers to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of their products.

### State Electronics Laws

Twenty-five U.S. states (plus the District of Columbia) currently have electronics recycling laws. The National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER) developed [an interactive map](https://www.ecycleclearinghouse.org/contentpage.aspx?pageid=10) that helps to find out detailed information on state regulations, including a brief summary and link to the laws as well as key dates. Visit NCERs website to find out more about [state electronics laws](https://www.electronicsrecycling.org/?page_id=37).

### Related Information

A [Sustainable Materials Management](/smm) approach seeks to:

* Use materials in the most productive way with an emphasis on using less.
* Reduce toxic chemicals and environmental impacts throughout the material lifecycle.
* Assure we have sufficient resources to meet today’s needs and those of the future.

Information on materials used in electronics are available in the following U.S. Geological Survey publications:

* [A World of Minerals in Your Mobile Device.](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/gip167)

* [Cobalt—For Strength and Color.](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3081/)

### Certified Electronics Recyclers

#### What Are Certified Electronics Recyclers?

EPA encourages all electronics recyclers to become certified by demonstrating to an accredited, independent third-party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics. Currently two accredited certification standards exist: the [Responsible Recycling (""R2"") Standard for Electronics Recyclers](https://sustainableelectronics.org/) and the [e-Stewards® Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment® (""e-Stewards®"")](http://e-stewards.org/). Both programs provide the following benefits:

* Advance best management practices
* Offer a way to assess the environmental, worker health, and security practices of entities managing used electronics
* Are based on strong environmental standards that maximize reuse and recycling, minimize exposure to human health or the environment, ensure safe management of materials by downstream handlers, and require destruction of all data on used electronics

Certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics. Once certified, continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body holds the recycler to the particular standard.

The ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) is the organization that accredits certifying bodies in the United States. They provide an [updated list of which certifying body has attained accreditation to which standard](http://anabdirectory.remoteauditor.com/).

#### Benefits of Becoming a Certified Recycler

Responsible electronics recycling provides important benefits, such as the following:

* Reducing environmental and human health impacts from improper recycling
* Increasing access to quality reusable and refurbished equipment to those who need it
* Reducing energy use and other environmental impacts associated with mining and processing of virgin materials, conserving our limited natural resources

#### Getting Certified

Electronics recyclers can visit the [R2](https://sustainableelectronics.org/) and [e-Stewards](http://e-stewards.org/)® websites to learn how to become a certified electronics recycler.

#### How to Find a Certified Recycler

##### For Businesses, Governments and Large Purchasers

EPA recommends using certified electronics recyclers to manage unwanted used electronics. Currently, there are two accredited certification standards in the United States: R2 and e-Stewards®. Both programs advance best management practices and offer a way to assess the environmental, worker health and safety, and security practices of entities managing used electronics. The links below will direct you to websites detailing locations of certified recyclers in these two programs and the services they provide.

## Implementation Study of the Electronics Recycling Standards: R2 and e-Stewards

EPA’s Implementation Study of the Responsible Recycling (""R2"") Standard for Electronics Recyclers and the e-Stewards® Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment© (""e-Stewards®"") recycling standards fulfills a key commitment under the [National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship](#nses), which tasks the federal government to lead by example in encouraging the environmentally preferable design and responsible management of used electronics. The study found that overall, the e-Stewards® and R2 certification programs are generally being implemented well with opportunities for improvement identified in many of the topic areas assessed in the study. EPA offers suggested strategies and recommendations for improving implementation of the Standards.

## National Strategy of Electronics Stewardship (NSES)

### What is the NSES?

[The National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship (NSES) (pdf)](/sites/default/files/2015-09/documents/national_strategy_for_electronic_stewardship_0.pdf) provides recommendations on steps the federal government, businesses, and all Americans can take toward achieving the goals identified in [Executive Order 13693, “Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade.”](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/19/executive-order-planning-federal-sustainability-next-decade)

The NSES results from collaboration among 16 federal departments and agencies, collectively known as the Interagency Task Force on Electronics Stewardship, as well as consultation with stakeholders from the electronics, retail, and recycling industries; environmental organizations; state and local governments; and concerned citizens. It has the following goals:

1. Build incentives for design of environmentally preferable electronics and enhance science, research, and technology development in the United States.
2. Ensure that the federal government leads by example.
3. Increase safe and effective management and handling of used electronics in the United States.
4. Reduce harm from U.S. exports of electronics waste (e-waste) and improve handling of used electronics in developing countries.

Introduction In recent years, there has been a rising recognition of the limitations of nonrenewable resources, which has prompted a move towards reliance on renewable resources. The transition has generated considerable eagerness to develop composite materials that possess both biodegradability and ecological sustainability [1]. Composite materials began to emerge during the 1940s, initially employing fibers as reinforcing substances [2]. Composites may be designed to exhibit specific characteristics by altering the mix of the reinforcing and matrix phases [3], [4]. Composite materials are currently undergoing development and redesign efforts to enhance traditional products due to their favorable characteristics, like elevated specific strength, lightweight, robust damping capacity, and heightened specific modulus. Now, a rise in the development and use of bio-composite materials is seen in various engineering applications, particularly those incorporating natural fibers (NFs) as additives or reinforcements [5]. Manufacturers and researchers show significant interest in natural fibers, including flax, hemp, jute, banana, sisal, kenaf, etc., due to their biodegradable nature and similar mechanical qualities. In contrast to synthetic fibers, these fibers also have lower costs and densities, making them suitable for producing lightweight constructions [6]. Also, natural fibers provide several benefits owing to their abundant supply and widespread availability [7], [8]. However, there are significant drawbacks that limit the utilization of natural fibers and recyclable polymers in the development of new composites. These drawbacks include their vulnerability to moisture https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4tcbv ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-8708-6718 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0 absorption, thermal degradation, and weathering effects on the fibers and the matrix. Additionally, these materials exhibit lower durability, inadequate interfacial adhesion resulting in debonding, and poor resin impregnation and wettability within the spaces between fibrils. Furthermore, the fibers are prone to breakage during the mixing stages of the manufacturing processes [9]. Researchers are endeavoring to overcome the limitations of natural fiber-based composites by carefully selecting various materials and designs. Despite the widespread use of natural fiber-based composites in industries such as automobiles, aerospace, packaging, construction, shipping pallets, and furniture, efforts are being made to achieve optimal outcomes [10]–[12]. Numerous research studies are underway to explore the untapped potential of these composites. This article aims to provide an extensive overview of composite materials constructed from natural fibers. It explores the several categories of natural fibers that are frequently utilized according to their properties, the techniques employed in producing natural fiber-based composite, and their concrete uses. 2. Natural Fibers and Types of NFs The term 'natural fibers' refers to a range of fibers derived from plants, minerals, and animals in their natural state [13]–[16]. These fibers are derived from leaves, stems, or seeds of multiple species of plants [17], [18]. Natural fibers have three major components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. In natural fibers, each individual filament is ten μm in diameter and consists of one primary cell wall and three secondary walls [19], [20]. Figure 1 provides a structural constitution of natural fiber cell wall [21], [22]. Figure 1. Structural constitutions of a natural fibers cell wall [21], [22] Among the natural fibers, cellulose or plant-based fibers have gained attention from scientists, researchers, and engineers due to their convenient accessibility, degradability, renewability, and eco-friendliness [23]–[25]. Plant fiber comprises seeds, bast fibers, leaves, fruit, grasses/reeds, straws, and wood fibers [26]–[30]. The detailed classification of NFs is illustrated in Figure 2. https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4tcbv ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-8708-6718 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

Characteristics and Properties of Natural Fibers Composite materials greatly value the distinctive characteristics and properties displayed by natural fibers. Materials such as cotton, jute, flax, hemp, wool, and silk are primarily well-known for their environmentally beneficial characteristics and properties and come from various sources, including plants and animals. In recent times, there has been a surge in researchers' interest in natural fibers on account of their renewability and sustainability attributes [27]. Natural fibers have greater strength and stiffness than synthetic fibers, depending on their chemical constitution and polymeric structure [34]. Here, Table 1 provides a concise overview of the characteristics of the NFs. Table 1. Summary of natural fibers characteristics [27], [35]–[47]. Fiber Description Abaca Manila hemp, or abaca, is a plant that is quite similar to banana plant. Although abaca plants resemble bananas, they are unsuitable for human consumption due to economic impracticability. In contrast to bananas, abaca plants are exclusively cultivated for their fibers [35]. Bamboo Bamboo is popular because of its high strength-to-weight ratio [36], fast growth, low water usage, no pesticides or herbicides, and root-intact harvesting. Lighter, stiffer, and stronger than glass fiber [37]. An analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy shows that bamboo fiber mats require only 17% of the energy needed to create glass fiber mats [38]. Coir Coir is highly desirable due to its superior durability compared to most natural fibers, is free from chemical treatment, and is widely available too [39], [40]. Cotton Cotton fiber is exceptionally absorbent [41]. 46% of the world's natural and synthetic fibers production is cotton [42]. Eucalyptus Although eucalyptus fiber is readily accessible, its resistance to fire and mold is inadequate. These bark fibers satisfy the requirements for insulating purposes [43]. Flax Glass fiber possesses a lower specific tensile strength than flax fiber. Furthermore, it possesses low density, high strength, and rigidity [44]. Hemp Young's modulus and mechanical strength of hemp fiber are both exceptional [44] excellent insulating properties [45]. https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4tcbv ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-8708-6718 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0 Fibre Description Jute Jute fiber is characterized by its favorable insulation properties and high strength-to-weight ratio [44]. Kenaf It has low density and high specific mechanical properties [44]. Pineapple Pineapple fiber possesses exceptional thermal, physical, and mechanical properties [47]. Ramie Glass fiber may have a lower specific strength and modulus of ramie than ramie fiber. However, it is not as well-liked as other natural fibers due to the costly pre-treatments it demands [46]. Sisal Sisal is a simple material to cultivate and regenerate rapidly. The fiber exhibits exceptional tenacity, tensile intensity, and resistance to abrasion, saline water, acids, and alkalis [44]. Raw materials' physical and chemical composition significantly influences natural fibers' ultimate mechanical properties [48]. Morphology, crystallinity, amorphous content, regular or irregular orderliness, processing method, the size of the natural fibers, and the stage of plant maturation are some additional factors to consider [49]–[51]. Moisture absorption, a significant concern about natural fibers, especially plant fibers, also depends on the chemical composition[50]–[53]. Specific properties influenced by chemical compositions and internal structures can be improved or modified through chemical treatments [54], [55]. Table 2 represents some physical and mechanical properties of natural fibers. Table 2. Properties of certain natural fibers [52], [56]–[64].

License: CC BY-NC 4.0 4. Manufacturing Composites The fabrication method of composite materials utilizing natural fibers is crucial in determining their final characteristics and potential uses. When integrating natural fibers with polymers or other matrices, it is imperative to thoroughly assess several factors to achieve optimal performance. This section provides a summary of the leading manufacturing techniques employed in the fabrication of natural fiber composites. 4.1 Natural fiber preprocessing Before integrating natural fibers into composites, it is crucial to carry out physical and chemical pretreatment procedures to improve their compatibility with the matrix material, as the presence of non-cellulose components such as hemicelluloses, pectin, and lignin in natural fibers leads to polar behavior. These components readily form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups (-OH), causing the separation of fibers from the matrix [65]. This limits the mechanical properties of natural fiber-reinforced composites [65]. The chemical treatments are alkali treatment, silane coupling, acetylation treatment, benzoylation treatment, peroxide treatment, sodium chlorite treatment, acrylation and acrylonitrile grafting, permanganate treatment, isocyanate treatment, stearic acid treatment, fungal treatment [21], [26], [66]–[74]. Also, the process includes carrying out physical treatments such as corona treatment, plasma treatment, ultraviolet irradiation treatment, and ozone treatment as necessary [75]–[78]. The process may encompass the purification, desiccation, and surface modification of fibers to eliminate contaminants and moisture and enhance bonding between the fiber and matrix [79]–[83]. 4.2 Matrix Selection and Preparation A matrix is employed in composites to bind the reinforcing components securely by surface adhesion. The primary duties of the matrix involve ensuring the composite's environmental resilience, surface aesthetics, and long-lasting nature [84]. Petrochemical-based thermosetting and thermoplastic polymers are commonly utilized as a matrix in natural fiber composites. Bio-based, fully degradable matrices are also used with natural fibers [22]. The matrix is formulated in a manner that is appropriate for the selected manufacturing technique, be it liquid for infusion or molten for injection. The characteristics of polymeric matrices utilized in composites are categorized in Table 3. https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4tcbv ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-8708-6718 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

Due to technological advancements and growing demand, processes such as additive manufacturing have evolved from semi-automated to fully automated. The closed mold techniques have gained popularity in the present century due to their superior precision, accuracy, and productivity [89], [90]. Choosing an appropriate manufacturing technique is crucial to shape the structure and achieve the specified composite technical qualities without any flaws. The primary manufacturing techniques for natural fiber composites include hand layup, compression molding, extrusion molding, injection molding, resin transfer molding, and automated fiber placement. Figure 3 displays these primary production procedures. 4.3.1 Hand layup The hand lay-up process is widely used, uncomplicated, and cost-effective for manufacturing composites [91]. This technology allows for the easy preparation of long and continuous composite materials made from natural fibers and a wide range of products [88]. It involves the initial application of a release agent, which acts as an anti-adhesive substance, to the open mold. Subsequently, the fibers are positioned within the mold. The application of resins to the fibers is accomplished through pouring and brushing using a roller or brush [92]–[94]. The lay-up process involves progressively adding layers until the appropriate thickness is achieved. Entrapped air in the laminate is manually removed by giving pressure using squeegees or rollers. In order to achieve a stronger interfacial bond among different materials, it is necessary to incorporate fiber, matrix, or both with elements that potentially assist that bonding [70]. The laminates are then allowed to cure under normal atmospheric conditions [92]. Another procedure called spray layup is almost similar to the hand layup technique. In spray layup, resin and shredded fibers are sprayed onto a mold using a handgun during that process [95], [96]. https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4tcbv ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-8708-6718 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

License: CC BY-NC 4.0 4.3.2 Compression molding The compression molding technique produces bulk composite components specifically for automotive, aerospace, and maritime applications. Two distinct types of compression molding process exist: hot compression molds and cold compression molds [26], [98]. Only pressure is exerted during cold compression, and curing occurs at ambient temperature. In contrast, the hot compression method involves the simultaneous application of pressure and temperature, with curing achieved by heating the mold [99]. The cavity is initially filled with materials that have been heated using this technique. The mold's core exerts significant pressure on the chamber, resulting in the compression and deformation of the pieces. The compression force must be maintained until the composite solidifies. The mold can be opened at this point, and the composite can be extracted [100]. The crucial variables to be considered in relation to this technique include the material quantity, heating duration, pressure exerted on the mold, and duration of cooling [101]. 4.3.3 Extrusion Molding Extrusion molding is a commonly employed technique for fabricating composite materials, enabling the production of materials that possess exceptional rigidity and durability [102]. The process commences by storing the thermoplastic material in the shape of pellets or grains within a hopper. Subsequently, they are transported to a heated barrel, where they are melted. The liquefied plastics are then utilized to get the desired form of the composite [84], [102]. A rectangular die was employed at the extruder's end, and the resulting extrudates were then cooled to the ambient temperature. Sometimes, silane was used in the extrusion process to enhance the characteristics of

## Introduction

The field of fashion encompasses how clothing mirrors our personality. Moreover, clothing serves as a means through which fashion communicates our vision, connecting us to temporal and spatial dimensions. Fashion is a complex and sophisticated concept encompassing the creation and use of clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, and jewelry within cultural aesthetics (Fletcher [Citation2012](#)). It is a powerful tool for self-expression, social identification, and communicating personal values and beliefs (Davis [Citation1992](#)). The demand for textile materials, which fluctuates in accordance with the ever-changing trends of fashion, is influenced directly or indirectly by consumer preferences. These preferences, in turn, drive the exploration of novel types of fiber that are sustainable and environmentally friendly (Bhuyan and Gogoi [Citation2020](#)). The discussion surrounding the concept of sustainability has grown substantially in recent decades. Sustainability is the idea of fulfilling present needs in a way that does not hinder future generations from satisfying their own needs (Keeble [Citation1988](#)). The concept of sustainability has experienced a transformation to encompass a harmonious equilibrium between financial, societal, and ecological components to fulfill future resource needs adequately (Hawkes [Citation2001](#); The Environmental Impact Of Composites [Citation2001](#)). Thus, the fashion industry increasingly recognizes the importance of sustainability as a prerequisite for its future (Dissanayake and Perera [Citation2016](#)).

A sustainable fashion industry perspective depends upon fiber, materials, and product innovations. Sustainable fibers contribute to addressing the environmental impact and represent an emerging trend within the fashion market (Dissanayake and Perera [Citation2016](#)). Numerous attempts have been made globally to cultivate fibers that possess the qualities of sustainability, biodegradability, lightness and affordability (Maiti et al. [Citation2022](#)).

Textile fibers serve as the fundamental components for producing fashion and textiles. Some common textile fibers such as cotton, wool, jute, and flax, all natural textile fibers, have been utilized in clothing production for the past 5000 years. Natural textile fibers are cultivated in many regions worldwide, spanning from the Northern to Southern Arctic Circle. Natural fibers, obtained from plants and animals (for example chicken feathers and hair), consist of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, waxes, and water-soluble compounds (Aziz and Ansell [Citation2004](#); Huda et al. [Citation2006](#); Kicińska-Jakubowska, Bogacz, and Zimniewska [Citation2012](#)). These fibers are renowned for their ability to recycle carbon dioxide (CO2) (R. M. Kozłowski and Mackiewicz-Talarczyk [Citation2020](#)). Due to the growing significance of sustainable fibers, textile producers and agricultural fiber growers are increasingly focusing on natural fibers. Natural fibers are inherently environmentally friendly until fertilizers, pesticides, and other toxic chemicals are introduced to boost production (Jhanji Dhir [Citation2022](#)).

In the early 20th century, there were sudden and significant advancements in synthetic fibers. Their superior and efficient manufacture and other desirable characteristics led to a decrease in desire for natural fibers and a swift capture of a remarkable portion of the market. However, the manufacture of synthetic fibers entailed using several chemicals and hazardous compounds that were detrimental to the environment and society. The implementation of environmental legislation and increased consumer awareness have led textile industries to abandon synthetic fibers and return to using historically and ecologically friendly natural fibers. To reduce the utilization of synthetic fiber due to environmental concerns, companies and individuals have shown an increased interest in natural and sustainable fibers (M. A. Ali and Sarwar [Citation2010](#)). Natural fibers are key to sustainable fashion due to their biodegradability, renewability, and less environmental impact than synthetics. Furthermore, the fashion industry’s present focus has grown to include not just the design aspects of products, but also their essential and therapeutic qualities. Although the idea of a “sustainable fiber” typically focuses on organic cotton or recycled polyester, most advancements that address sustainability while also offering appealing qualities are limited to a certain market niche (Dissanayake and Perera [Citation2016](#)).

This review focuses on the potential and outlook of natural fibers in the fashion industry and their contribution to sustainability. We also examined the environmental effects associated with producing different textile fibers. The paper provides a comprehensive review of natural fibers, which is a specific research area within sustainable fashion. It covers various aspects, including production, applications, properties, and cost considerations, synthesizing a broad range of information into a cohesive analysis. The initial section provides a concise overview of various textile fibers, categorized according to their origins. Primary textile fibers, including cotton, silk, wool, polyester, nylon, and rayon, were examined regarding their physical and chemical qualities, cultivation methods, and production procedures, considering their environmental, social, and economic consequences. Sustainability concerns, encompassing air, water, and soil pollution, are also addressed as well as the effects of fiber manufacture on human health and animal welfare. The paper evaluates the progress made in the use of natural fibers in the fashion industry, highlighting the shift from synthetic to natural materials. It examines how these developments are shaping the industry’s move toward sustainability, indicating an assessment of ongoing trends and advancements. In addition, the various opportunities for natural fibers for sustainable fashion and potential constraints in the future have also been highlighted. We aimed to provide literature succinctly and efficiently for keyword accessibility. Such a study on sustainable materials in a fashion that provides literature with keyword accessibility is essential to meet the growing demand for clear, accessible information in a complex field. It supports researchers, educators, and industry professionals by simplifying the search for relevant data, enhancing educational efforts, and promoting informed, sustainable practices. By critically assessing the environmental impact, cost-effectiveness, and the increasing demand for natural fibers, the review addresses key issues relevant to the fashion and textiles industry. It offers insights into both the benefits and challenges associated with natural fibers, making it a valuable contribution to the discourse on sustainable fashion.

## Materials and method

This study employs a systematic literature review approach to comprehensively analyze commercially significant natural fibers within the sustainable fashion sector. It aims to synthesize existing research on their production processes, properties, applications in fashion, and associated cost implications. A wide array of academic and industry sources was utilized to ensure a robust analysis, including databases such as Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, JSTOR, and various industry reports (e.g., McKinsey & Company, Textile Exchange). The search was guided by keywords like “natural fibers,” “sustainable fashion,” “fiber production,” “environmental impact of fashion,” and “cost of natural fibers.”

The selection of articles was based on specific inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed journal articles published in the last 30 years, industry reports discussing natural fiber trends and innovations, and studies examining the environmental impact and sustainability of these fibers in fashion. Exclusion criteria included articles that did not focus on natural fibers and studies lacking empirical data or relevant case studies.

Data extraction was conducted using a standardized form to capture key information from each selected source, recording details such as the type of natural fiber (e.g., cotton, linen, hemp, silk), production methods (e.g., agricultural practices, processing techniques), properties (e.g., durability, biodegradability, moisture absorption), applications in fashion (e.g., types of garments, accessories), and cost considerations (e.g., production costs, market pricing). Both qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed to identify trends, benefits, and challenges associated with sustainably using natural fibers.

The synthesized findings were organized thematically, focusing on the environmental impact of natural fibers compared to synthetic alternatives, market trends that highlight the growing demand for these materials, and economic aspects that analyze production costs and pricing strategies for natural fiber-based products. The review concludes with recommendations for industry stakeholders on leveraging natural fibers to enhance sustainability within the fashion sector. It is important to note that the review is limited to the availability of published literature, which may not encompass all emerging trends or innovations in natural fiber production, and future research should consider ongoing developments in material science and shifts in consumer behavior toward sustainable fashion practices.

### Natural fiber

Natural fibers, which are a crucial component of human natural surroundings, also serve as vital resources for both textile and non-textile manufacturing. Natural fiber is a rapidly growing and environmentally conscious product that is widely used in the textile industry and other fields. Natural fibers of plant and animal origin have accompanied human existence for thousands of years. A very desirable textile raw material is distinguished by certain functional properties that are beneficial to both humans and the natural environment. Because of their distinct characteristics, they are utilized in nearly every sector of the economy and are superb source material for producing so-called “green products” (Bhuyan and Gogoi [Citation2020](#); Kicińska-Jakubowska, Bogacz, and Zimniewska [Citation2012](#)). The renewable nature of natural fibers renders them a superior option for achieving sustainable supply. This is due to their low cost, low density, minimal processing expenses, absence of health risks, and remarkable mechanical and physical properties. Among these properties, the most significant ones are their ability to biodegrade and their non-carcinogenic nature, leading to their resurgence in popularity. Additionally, their cost-effectiveness further enhances their appeal (Satyanarayana et al. [Citation1990](#); Yan, Chouw, and Jayaraman [Citation2014](#)).

Today’s manufacturing sectors prioritize creating environmentally friendly goods, and environmental sustainability is becoming a tradition worldwide. These environmentally friendly goods are made using natural fibers since they decompose naturally (G. K. Sathishkumar et al. [Citation2022](#)). To produce the most sustainable, biodegradable, and premium natural fiber goods, scientists, researchers, and practitioners from all over the world have been attempting to optimize the potential of natural fibers (Karimah, Ridho, Munawar, Adi, et al. [Citation2021a](#); Madhu et al. [Citation2020](#); Vinod et al. [Citation2020](#)). Natural fibers have been essential to human civilization as sustainable, ecologically acceptable sources of raw materials to produce green products (Karimah, Ridho, Munawar, Adi, et al. [Citation2021a](#)), which is now translating to the broader fashion industry.

### Classification of natural fibers

Natural fibers are largely classified according to their derivation from botanical, zoological, or mineral sources (Rajak et al. [Citation2019](#); Ramamoorthy, Skrifvars, and Persson [Citation2015](#)). Certain natural fibers are derived from distinct portions of trees and plants. Cellulosic fibers obtained from plants can be primarily categorized into seed fibers (like cotton, kapok, and coir), bast fibers (like flax, jute, hemp, ramie, and kenaf), and leaf fibers (like pineapple, sisal, banana, and abaca) (see ). Natural fibers based on cellulose can be derived from various parts of plants and vegetables, including the leaf, stem, stalk, seed, fruit, grass/reeds, and husk/hull (Brouwer [Citation2000](#)). Several leaf fibers are found in nature, including pineapple leaf fiber (PALF), curaua, sisal, piassava, and abaca (Bismarck, Mishra, and Lampke [Citation2005](#)). Natural plant fibers are sourced from vegetable sources, resulting in their biodegradability and sustainability (Günay [Citation2018](#); Sun and Cheng [Citation2002](#); Thygesen et al. [Citation2005](#), [Citation2011](#)).

Figure 1.  Classification of natural fiber (Khalid et al. [Citation2021](#); Saxena et al. [Citation2011](#)).

Commercially available natural fibers worldwide include cotton, wool, jute, coir, flax, sisal, abaca, hemp, ramie, and silk from various plant and animal species (","## 4. Sustainable Materials in Electronics

**Biodegradable substrates and recycled plastics are pivotal in reducing e-waste and supporting a circular economy.** Recent advancements in biodegradable materials, such as polylactic acid (PLA) and cellulose-based substrates, have demonstrated significant potential in eco-friendly electronics.

                    Focus Topics – Environmental matters

                    # Circular products and innovation

                    ## Impacts, risks, and opportunities

                    #### Impacts

                    Zehnder’s focus on circular products reduces waste, extends product life cycles, and minimises the need for new raw materials. The company promotes the reuse and refurbishment of products, which lowers resource demand and reduces embedded CO2e emissions. By increasing repairability and recyclability, Zehnder helps mitigate environmental impacts across its product portfolio.

                    #### Risks and opportunities

                    Zehnder faces challenges in transitioning to circular products, including the high cost and limited availability of recycled materials, which can drive up production expenses and complicate circular product design. Meeting growing customer expectations for durability and repairability is also critical; failure to do so risks reputational damage and potential market share loss. Regulatory changes related to circular economy practices also pose a risk, as Zehnder must stay ahead of evolving standards.

                    Despite these challenges, adopting circular economy principles presents substantial opportunities. Designing products that are energy-efficient, durable, and repairable not only reduces waste and extends life cycles but also supports environmental goals while cutting costs. Circular product design enables innovative business models, such as product-as-a-service, aligning with the rising demand for sustainable and adaptable solutions. This shift toward circularity strengthens Zehnder’s market position as consumers and regulators increasingly prioritise sustainability.

                    ## Management approach

                    Zehnder is dedicated to enhancing its circular product portfolio by prioritising durability, repairability, and recyclability. The company has intensified efforts to ensure products are designed to last longer and can be efficiently refurbished or recycled at the end of their life cycle.

                    Alongside internal efforts, Zehnder collaborates with suppliers to source more sustainable materials, such as carbon-reduced steel, and to integrate recycled materials into new product developments. The company also seeks to minimise the use of primary raw materials, particularly in packaging, with ongoing projects focused on reducing material usage and increasing the proportion of recycled content.

                    #### Clean Air Solutions

                    This model facilitates the reuse of products through refurbishment and redeployment, offering customers clean air solutions while reducing the need for new resources. The service covers equipment installation, maintenance, air filter replacements, and air quality monitoring. Upon termination of service agreements, Zehnder recovers and refurbishes the equipment, promoting resource efficiency and providing customers with a flexible solution.

                    #### Circular Design Guideline

                    Zehnder’s Circular Design Guideline ensures sustainability is integrated into every stage of product development. It prioritises the use of recycled materials, extends product life cycles through repairability and refurbishment, and encourages circular business models. Competence Centres are responsible for applying these principles across product lines, supported by the Group Sustainability Engineer, who coordinates LCAs and builds internal expertise. This role focuses on improving recyclability, repairability, and raw material selection. Competence Centres implement sustainability initiatives, track KPIs, and utilise LCAs to create certified environmental product declarations, meeting both methodological standards and customer expectations.

                    ## Implementation and outlook

                    To implement the above management approach and policies, we outlined two ambitions, each underpinned by one or more targets and monitored via specific KPIs.

                    #### Targets

                    **Ambition: Understand and improve the environmental impacts of our products**

                    **Target: Conduct life cycle assessments for each product family/technology**

                    - **Status:** The target has evolved from completing one LCA per product family/technology to prioritising LCAs based on the Group Product LCA Directive. In 2024, eight LCAs were completed for all product groups, resulting in a total of eleven LCAs so far. This marks the completion of approximately one-third of the product families/technologies, with significant work still ahead of us.
                    - **Outlook:** In 2025, we will expand the scope of LCAs to include products from our overseas locations. We are focused to enhance our LCA expertise and aim to have a significant share of the outstanding analysis completed. We strive for a 20% improvement in our environmental impact for new products launched after 2025 based on the EF 3.1 Environmental Footprint method recommended by the European Commission.

                    **Ambition: Increase the durability and circularity of our products by promoting reuse, repair, refurbishment, recycling and recovery**

                    **Target: Develop and apply a Circular Design Guideline**

                    - **Status:** Following the development of the Circular Design Guideline in 2023, the target has shifted to focus on its rollout and application across all new product development projects. The guideline has been successfully implemented within our Competence Centres, including Radiators Europe, Comfosystems Europe, Clean Air Solutions, and CORE. The Circular Design Guideline emphasises three main circularity topics: designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. These topics are crucial for creating sustainable products that minimise environmental impact and support a circular economy. By focusing on eliminating waste and pollution through innovative design strategies, the guidelines aim to reduce the negative effects of production and consumption on the environment. Keeping products and materials in use involves extending their life cycle through reuse, repair, refurbishing, and recycling, ensuring that resources are utilised efficiently and effectively. Regenerating natural systems supports and enhances natural processes, helping to maintain environmental balance and promote ecosystem health. New business models are essential for enhancing circularity, yet they are challenging to develop in a way that creates a win-win situation for our company, our customers, and the environment.
                    - **Outlook:** In the coming year, we will further refine the Circular Design Guideline to provide stronger support for our development teams. We encourage them to explore innovative and sustainable approaches to minimise the environmental impact of our products.

                    **Target: Pilot ventilation-as-a-service and refurbishment business models in the Netherlands**

                    - **Status:** Today all of our ventilation-as-a-service revenue is generated through our Clean Air Solutions business. However, we see potential for ventilation-as-a service and also refurbishment business models in our Comfosystems business where Zehnder traditionally sells ventilation units and air distribution equipment. This is why three pilot projects are in progress to further expand these offerings. It became evident that the enterprise resource planning infrastructure is not ready yet to scale these offerings in the future. Supplier interviews and market assessments are underway, although market readiness remains a challenge in certain areas. The Circularity Taskforce Netherlands has initiated stakeholder interviews to explore innovative circular business concepts, while the EMEA Workstream Circular Economy has broadened the initiative to a European level. So far, five potential business models have been identified – two at Comfosystems and three at Radiator sites.
                    - **Outlook:** While still in the early stages, these efforts are progressing with interviews being set up to further evaluate the feasibility and potential of the identified business models. Further insights will shape the development of scalable solutions. By 2030, we aim for a significant part of our net sales to stem from refurbished products/service business, including revenue from Clean Air Solutions.

                    **Target: Increase the share of recycled raw materials in our products**

                    - **Status:** Building on the achievements of 2023, which saw significant progress in integrating recycled aluminium into radiators and setting a 25% recycled polymer content requirement for new air distribution products, Zehnder is further advancing its efforts to increase the use of recycled raw materials across its product portfolio. The concept phase for products with more than 80% recycled raw materials and recyclability was launched in 2024 and is showing mixed results. Pilot projects have assessed the viability of eco-friendly materials, such as bamboo and cardboard, for alternative product components. For Comfosystems, progress is more advanced, with tools soon to be developed for a 100% recycled content air distribution duct.
                    - **Outlook:** We will advance concepts and trials for steel radiators and ventilation units and explore opportunities for heat exchangers. Regular assessments will support progress toward achieving >80% recycled content and recyclability targets. Our 2030 target is to use a significant share of recycled raw materials for most of our products.

                    **Target: Increase the share of recycled packaging materials**

                    - **Status:** Efforts to increase recycled and reusable materials in packaging are progressing steadily. In the Radiator division, stretch plastic was eliminated for white aluminium products, saving 4 tons of plastic annually. Packaging films and tapes now contain 50–70% recycled content and bubble nylon has been replaced with 100% recycled low-density polyethylene. Additionally, reusable plastic boxes have replaced cardboard for bracket sets, and strapping tape includes 30% recycled content. In CORE, new recyclable packaging features 71% recycled content in the main body, with fresh fibre paper ensuring quality for the inner and outer layers. The base and lid include 95% recycled content, and supports are made entirely from 100% recycled materials. In 2024, we achieved a Group-wide total of 54.2% of recycled packaging materials (excluding pallets), based on calculations (compared to the estimate of 54% in the previous year). The difference can be attributed to improved data quality, which provided a more accurate assessment of our recycled material usage.
                    - **Outlook:** We identified that almost 75% of our packaging materials (excluding pallets) used across the group are cardboard and paper, however not at the highest recycled content rate possible – this is an improvement potential we are going to utilise in 2025. Plans are underway to phase out styrofoam spacers for radiators from external suppliers and to eliminate heat shrink foil from all radiators by 2025. In Bolesławiec (Poland) a new packaging system will be commissioned in January 2025, removing the use of film around cartons. The protective film around radiators, however, will remain to ensure safe transport and safeguard the assembled units on-site until all construction work is completed, and the final handover takes place.   
                        
                      In Clean Air Solutions, building on the existing reusable packaging system for filter frames, efforts are focused on expanding sustainable packaging options. This includes evaluating lightweight packaging films with recycled content to improve material efficiency and further reduce environmental impact.  
                        
                      We aim to achieve 80% recycled or reusable packaging materials (excluding pallets) for outbound transportation by 2025, a goal established for our Competence Centres. For the remaining 20% of new (non-recycled) packaging materials, we are committed to adhering to the highest ecolabel standards.

                    **Target: Conduct feasibility study for reusable and/or recycled pallets**

                    - **Status:** The feasibility study on recycled content and reusability of pallets sets the foundation for our 2025 targets. It evaluates carbon impact reduction options, tracks pallet flows, and identifies suppliers for potential pallet return systems. Key challenges include standardising master data and addressing market barriers to efficient pallet returns. The study emphasises two main priorities – standardising pallets internally to minimise complexity and working with Commercial EMEA to develop a process for retrieving pallets from customers, with potential support from service providers such as Boomerang.
                    - **Outlook:** Next year’s objectives include launching an internal pallet standardisation project and collaborating with Commercial EMEA to design and test pilot concepts for customer pallet returns. These initiatives will be essential for establishing a sustainable and efficient pallet management system.

The PaaS opportunity Sustainable lifecycle management: PaaS models can facilitate better lifecycle management, efficient in-life management, and circular end-of-life handling. Manufacturers that offer services to refurbish returned products, could benefit from reduced waste, lower raw material costs, and easing supply chain challenges. [...] Measuring the PaaS impact The EU Taxonomy clearly identifies two KPIs to prove PaaS services are circular - services must result in either extended product lifespans or enhanced product utilizationxxv. Beyond this, accurately assessing the environmental impact of PaaS models in terms of CO2 emission reduction, resource efficiency and waste reduction, can be more challenging. Assets with lifecycles that span several decades, for example, can be difficult to track and monitor as possession of the asset transfers between different parties, and accessing and maintaining environmental data can also be an issue over the longer term. [...] GE Healthcare’s PaaS model for medical imaging equipment promotes equipment reuse and refurbishment. Extending the life of 6700 units of imaging and ultrasound equipment, led to the reduction of 5.15 million kilograms of potential landfill waste.lxvii “Our strategy is to manage the entire lifecycle of our equipment, from new sales to refurbishment, while navigating the complexities of pay-per-use and circular economy models,” said Jesus Blasco.

ABOUT THIS REPORT This report has been commissioned by BNP Paribas and BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions. The research was conducted by Do Well Do Good, a purpose-led strategy consultancy. The report aims to contribute to advancing Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) business models, in line with the European Union’s efforts to promote the transition towards a circular economy. The report offers an overview of the role of the PaaS in the circular economy ecosystem. It also explores two key sectors in depth, examining how agricultural equipment and green tech have responded to opportunities and challenges presented by PaaS models. These industries have been identified as core sectors for BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions due to their significant economic impact and the possibility of integrating PaaS models into their operations. Additional insights have also been gathered across four other sectors – heavy vehicles, healthcare, IT, and construction.
While researching this report, interviews were conducted with 28 industry experts across six industries, who were asked to share their comprehensive understanding of how PaaS models are transforming traditional business practices in their field. 3 BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions 4 Harnessing the power of Product-as-a-Service “ ANNE POINTET Head of Company Engagement, BNP Paribas PRODUCT-AS-A-SERVICE FOR SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODELS We live in a world undergoing constant change, driven largely by technological advances and the urgent need to address climate change. We’re witnessing innovation across almost every key economic sector from agriculture to transportation, construction, and healthcare. However, these technologies, while improving efficiency and productivity, may come with some drawbacks. First, they may demand consequent natural resources despite our global consumption already exceeding Earth’s regenerative capacity. Second, they could be more expensive for end-clients, posing a risk to the transition. At BNP Paribas, our role is to inform our clients about these transformations so they can benefit from them, while ensuring their long-term viability, hence calling for more sustainable and accessible consumption models. Aligning with the European Union’s Green Deal, BNP Paribas has identified the Circular Economy as one of five priorities in the Sustainability pillar of its GTS (Growth, Technology, Sustainability) 2025 strategic plan. Our goal is to find solutions that meet our clients’ needs while respecting the planet’s limits and aiming for carbon neutrality, which is at the core of Circular Economy.
In this study, we aim to explore the role of Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) as a key enabler of the Circular Economy. PaaS shifts the focus from asset ownership to service, usage, and performance. This business model is based on a comprehensive understanding of product lifecycles and grants usage of an asset to a client - but never outright ownership - through long-term contracts or pay-per-performance schemes. PaaS can help to unlock opportunities for various stakeholders. Businesses, for example, can benefit from lower upfront costs and inclusive services, which is crucial in facilitating access to sustainable technologies. Manufacturers may see a new business model opportunity with recurring, predictable revenue streams and potentially closer relationships with the end-client. But this shift from the traditional sales models will require the value chain to be reconsidered and redeveloped within a wider ecosystem. These client-focused transformations brought by PaaS represent considerable opportunities for both business and the planet and a significant evolution for BNP Paribas as we strive to support the adoption of more sustainable business practices.
“ 5 BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions “ “ NEIL PEIN CEO, BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions EQUIPMENT FINANCE FOR A CHANGING WORLD Change is the only constant, and today it seems to be happening faster than ever. Technology is advancing, the climate is evolving, and the business environment is transforming. Companies are increasingly aware that their actions resonate far beyond their walls, impacting complex value chains. In this dynamic world, businesses are having to adapt and innovate to grow sustainably.
However, the way organizations procure and manage assets has lagged behind. Many still heavily invest in purchasing equipment, only to face repair costs and inefficiencies as assets age. In this linear economy, these assets often end up discarded, wasting residual value.
The circular economy offers a game-changing alternative. By maximizing the utility of materials through sustainable practices like repair, refurbishment, and recycling, businesses can extend the lifecycle of assets and reduce waste. This approach ensures that resources remain productive, contributing to long-term sustainability.
Sustainable finance and innovative payment models, such as Product-as-a-Service (PaaS), play a crucial role in enabling circularity. These models allow businesses to access essential equipment without owning it outright, reducing upfront costs and enabling investment in green technologies. Ownership remains with the manufacturer or financier, who provides value-added services like warranties, insurance, maintenance, and operational insights. This not only enhances productivity but also encourages responsible use.
For manufacturers, PaaS is transformative. By shifting from selling products to delivering services across the asset lifecycle, they can unlock new revenue streams. Stronger customer relationships emerge through ongoing support, while predictable revenues enable investments in innovation and sustainability.
In transitioning to a circular economy, PaaS empowers businesses to decouple growth from resource consumption. At BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions, we’re committed to creating an ecosystem where sustainable finance drives progress, helping companies thrive while safeguarding our planet for future generations.
6 Harnessing the power of Product-as-a-Service THE CIRCULAR OPPORTUNITY Over the last five years the circular economy has gained momentum with the volume of discussions on this topic almost tripling, according to the Circular Economy Foundation.iv Governments worldwide are insisting on a swift, circular transition. Consumers are demanding change, and businesses are following suit. Organizations big and small are committing to transforming their operations in line with circular economy principles, including hundreds of leading brands from Ikeav to Adidasvi and the world’s largest brewer, AB InBevvii. The transition to a circular economy has the potential to spark new innovations, supercharge the economy, create jobs, address some of the key causes of climate change, and re-energize local communities. But despite the opportunity it presents, today, the global economy is only 7.2% circular, with the share of secondary materials we consume dropping 21% since 2018.
viii It’s clear that to make the circular economy a reality and turn hype into action, governments and businesses need practical ways to implement circularity across their value chain. But first, what is the circular economy?
The circular economy is a alternative way of thinking about production and consumption that reduces both the consumption of raw material and the production of waste by extending the utilization and lifespan of products and materials. It’s the opposite to a linear economy, which is characterized by a take-make-dispose approach to resource consumption. In a circular economy, products are designed to stay in circulation, with resources being used again and again to extract their maximum value, before becoming waste and being recycled for their component parts. More concretely, as long as the solution reduces negative environmental impact, mechanisms that can achieve circularity can include: Circular inputs: When virgin material is substituted with secondary or recycled materials in the production process, or single-lifecycle materials are replaced by fully recyclable components.
Circular design: Designing products to reduce material consumption through increased durability, increased modularity for ease of repair and recycling, and methods to avoid premature obsolescence.
Product lifetime extension: Processes that increase product utilization, including reuse, remanufacturing, repairing, refurbishing, repurposing, and the re-sale of second-hand goods.
Sharing business models: Services that optimise utilisation of products to reduce the production of new goods.
Product-as-a-Service: Selling products through use-orientated or result-orientated services such as leasing or pay per service contracts, where ownership of the asset remains with the manufacturer or lessor.
Material / resource recycling: Operations by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials, or substances.
7 BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions What are the benefits of circularity?
The circular economy is key to the fight against climate change and resource depletion. By reducing the need for new products, increasing product utilization and efficiency, and encouraging reuse, circularity can deliver huge environmental benefits, including: Shifting away from traditional production and consumption also improves economic stability, relieving pressure on overstretched supply chains, mitigating price fluctuations, and reducing import dependence.xiv Preserving natural capital and reducing biodiversity loss.
Reducing energy usage and GHG emissions.
Limiting the overconsumption of resources.
Minimizing waste.
Why circular, why now?
90% of land-based biodiversity loss and water stress are caused by raw material extraction and processing.ix US$80–120 billion of plastic packaging material value is lost to the economy after a short first use, equal to about 95% of its total value.xi US$4.5 trillion in additional economic output could be generated by a circular economy by 2030.xii 3.9 million people in Europe are estimated to be employed in jobs directly associated with the circular economy in 2018. xiii 90% of the resources consumed worldwide end up in waste.x US$62 billion worth of recoverable natural resources used in electronics alone is lost every year as waste.
WHAT OUR EXPERTS TOLD US: Jean Philippe Hermine is Director of the Mobility in Transition Institute and Associate Researcher at the Institute of Sustainable Development and International Relations.
“The circular economy requires us to rethink the product as a set of components, some of which are extremely strategic and do not necessarily have the same life cycle.” $ 8 Harnessing the power of Product-as-a-Service THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY: FROM REGULATION TO REALITY Europe is striving to become the world’s first carbon neutral continent and has developed a comprehensive regulatory framework to support this transition. Central to this is the EU Green Deal - a regulatory roadmap towards achieving Europe’s sustainable future.xv One of the Green Deal’s major building blocks is the Circular Economy Action Plan, a package of policies focused on reducing pressure on natural resources, changing our production and consumption habits, and minimizing wastexvi. It includes new regulations designed to ensure that businesses are aiming their influence, purchase power, and impact in the right direction. And that consumers have access to clear and transparent information about how to use their own purchase power for good. So, what does it all mean for European businesses?
A focus on sustainable product design In a circular economy, manufacturers play a key role in ensuring the principles of circularity are applied throughout design and production process. With this in mind, the EU has begun implementing new legal frameworks, including the Sustainable Product Initiativexvii and the Eco-design Directivexviii, to ensure all products produced or sold in the EU align with sustainability standards. This means products must be more durable, reusable, repairable, recyclable, and energy efficient.
Enshrining the right to repair Adding to this is a new EU rule that aims to make repairing products easier and more attractive for consumers. Right to Repair legislation puts the onus on manufacturers to repair a product for a reasonable price and within a reasonable timeframe, even after the warranty period has expiredxix. As well as informing consumers about their rights to repair, manufacturers will also have to provide reasonably priced spare parts and will be prohibited from using contractual or technical practices to prevent repairs. Extended Producer Responsibility Manufacturers must also consider the new focus on Extended Producer Responsibility, which ensures producers are operationally and financially responsible for a product throughout its lifecycle and requires intervention before products become waste via initiatives such as take-back schemes, repair services, and spare part sales.
Greenwashing The EU has amended the Unfair Commercial Practices Directivexx, preventing companies from making misleading environmental claims, or as it’s more commonly known, “greenwashing”. This places the requirement on organizations to provide substantive proof of their environmental credentials and use clear, transparent language across all reporting, labels, and marketing.
Rigorous reporting Following the introduction of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directivexxi (CSRD) and the Sustainability Due Diligence Directivexxii a growing number of companies with a European presence are required to report on both their environmental and human rights impact across their entire value chain and have a plan to mitigate these impacts. The CSRD requires in-scope companies to report as soon as 2025, based on 2024 data, across a range of ESG issues, including, for the first time ever, circular economy performance. 9 BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions Timeline of EU laws showcasing the EU’s circular economy evolution 2008 2021 2022 2015 2020 2023 2018 2019 2024 Extended Producer Responsibilities (EPR) Single-Use Plastics Directive Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation Revision of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive Circular Economy Action Plan European Green Deal New Circular Economy Action Plan Sustainable Products Initiative Taxonomy Regulation Implementation Revisited Waste Framework Directive CSRD Proposal Right to Repair Initiative EPR Implementation WHAT OUR EXPERTS TOLD US: Stéphane Dierick is Director of Cloud Projects at Zuora, an industry leading provider of subscription and monetization solutions.
“As regulatory pressures increase, more businesses will turn to circular and PaaS models to stay competitive and compliant.” 9 BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions 10 Harnessing the power of Product-as-a-Service SUSTAINABLE FINANCE IN THE CIRCULAR ECOSYSTEM The transition to a circular economy is, at its heart, an economic transition. This transformation may include a new financial taxonomy, structural changes to production, market reform, and the adoption of innovative technology and digital tools. Global financial institutions have a critical role to play in redirecting finance towards low carbon, circular solutions. The financial levers and products they offer have the potential to be agents for change.
Supporting circular economy business models Global ambitions to address climate change have led to the rise of green bonds and sustainable finance, which prioritize investments in projects that have a positive environmental impact. Financial institutions may also redirect funding to initiatives that adhere to circular economy principles, channeling investment into organizations, projects, and technologies that are both environmentally sustainable and economically viable over the long term. Banks could also play a role in supporting new circular innovation, by providing financial backing to entrepreneurs and start-ups. From ownership to access Financial products, like leasing, can enable the shift from traditional product sales and ownership by providing the contractual framework that allows ownership to be retained by one party, while the user of the product may change. These circular, service-based models allow customers to benefit from using things, without having to own them. The leasing model can encourage the maintenance and preservation of the asset’s condition to retain its value for future use, either by the same customer or by others. This approach aligns with the principles of the circular economy, which emphasizes keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible to reduce waste and the need for new resources. Evolving to meet new societal needs As society adapts to address the challenges of climate change, financial services may also begin to evolve in response. Take low emission zones, for example. Regulations are beginning to have an impact on consumer behavior, with consumers starting to shift towards circular mobility alternatives, like ride share and carpooling. Businesses are also starting to focus on upgrading or replacing their existing fleets, and this in turn will prompt local authorities to implement new infrastructure, like charging stations. Financial institutions can act as facilitators in this process by adapting traditional finance models, like lending, leasing, and insurance, to support these new business models and encourage collaboration across the ecosystem.

11 BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions Value creation and risk mitigation Research by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Bocconi Universityxxiii found that circular economy adoption can be used as a de-risking strategy for businesses. Their analysis of more than 200 European companies across 14 industries showed the more circular a company is, the lower its risk of default on debt over both a one and five-year period. Higher levels of circularity were responsible for “superior risk-adjusted stock performance for European listed companies”.
As investors become more aware of the ESG risks associated with climate change they can influence organizations to tackle those risks more effectively, by supporting clients with the education and financial mechanisms required to transition to circular models.
Enabling and connecting Financial institutions have strong enterprise client bases to scale solutions, trusted reputations, strong regulatory parameters, expertise in contracting and credit-risk evaluation, and established global networks. These credentials make them facilitators in a circular economy ecosystem, in which a cross-section of organizations and trusted partners, as wide-ranging as manufacturers, dealers, legal services, consulting firms, billing companies, and asset disposal firms, are collaborating, sharing information, and working together to support the transition to circular and service-based models. 11 BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions 12 Harnessing the power of Product-as-a-Service WHAT IS PRODUCT-AS-A-SERVICE?
Circularity is a powerful guiding principle for sustainable growth, but organizations also need practical tools to help them implement this new way of doing things. This is where service models, like Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) come in.
In a PaaS model customers pay for the services and outcomes a product can provide, rather than for ownership of the asset itself. Payment is made on a regular basis over the contract term, instead of purchasing a product outright. Additional services such as maintenance, insurance and asset tracking

Relevant Content: such as material use reduction and product reuse, recycling, and recovery (CCED, 2024). The MSU CEI will prioritize activities that provide much-needed support to industries critical to Michigan’s (and beyond) economy such as the automotive, chemical, agri-business and infrastructural materials (built environment) sectors. Strategic advancement will leverage the Institute’s consortium in critical topical areas such as materials upcycling and remanufacturing, new product design and development, extended producer responsibility, business development, materials salvage and recovery, reuse and resale, networking, and public policy. Capitalizing on these strengths, the MSU CEI would also serve as a central hub, catalyst, and a leader of efforts to mitigate the 23 negative social, economic, and [...] production and processing (REMADE, 2024). Through their primary purpose of driving down the cost of technologies essential to reuse, remanufacturing and recycling energy-intensive materials, REMADE has four goal areas that round out their mission: (1) Developing technologies capable of reducing energy emissions through a reduction in primary materials consumption and increase in secondary feedstock use in energy-intensive industries, (2) Developing technologies capable of achieving feedstock “better than cost and energy parity” for key secondary materials, (3) Promoting widespread application of new enabling technologies across multiple industries, and (4) Educating, training and developing the incumbent and future workforce to support deployment of REMADE technologies. REMADE also offers [...] innovation hubs where private enterprises strategically co-locate and collaborate to develop and deploy new, cleaner manufacturing technologies and conduct research and development to reduce emissions from hard-to-decarbonize industries.” The document also sets a goal to “triple Michigan’s recycling rate to 45 percent and cut food waste in half by 2030” (EGLE, 2022). These goals are heavily invested and strategically developed to support manufacturing industries by improving their efficiency in both material waste and consumer use. By having such goals to reduce food, material, and consumer waste, industries are also positioning to directly support small and medium-sized businesses in their transition to circular economy practices.

This strategy is reliant on the continual extraction of resources and short material lifecycles, normalizing intense waste generation. The linear economy critically lacks coordination between supply chain sectors and is increasingly susceptible to economic, environmental, and social disruptions. Circular economic modeling can offer a transformative framework for addressing the current disconnect between economic and environmental health and sustainability. Circular practices represent a systemic shift towards long-term environment, social, and economic resilience by embracing ecological truths, working to keep materials in use longer, and embracing collaboration throughout a material’s life cycle. Circular-supportive policy can also be important to addressing some of the most complex and pressing issues of the 21st century. This paradigm shift has the potential to combat economic instability and social inequalities, and may also be fundamental in confronting environmental health concerns including climate change. As the concept of circularity has gained traction in the United States and across the globe, many businesses are beginning to adopt circular practices that reduce material waste disposal costs while helping them to adopt more carbon neutral production practices. The capacity as a state and nation to identify, discover and disseminate best practices in material waste reduction, salvage and reuse are critical to maintaining a quality environment into the future and competing in the global economy as a part of circularity. To enter the broader circularity network at this time means joining a pivotal moment at which critical advancements and innovations are not only necessary, but increasingly tangible. Therefore, this overview attempts to provide an environmental scan of current circular practices, with focus on small and medium-sized businesses, while identifying opportunities and transitions that support more regenerative practice and market development. Beginning with a global overview, innovation across the United States is then discussed and specific leading sectors highlighted. The scan also provides an overview of recycling initiatives and equity in transition. This information builds context for state of Michigan activities, related legislation and academic institution educational and training efforts that support innovative circular economies and transition from traditional markets. In conclusion, activities specific to forming a Michigan State University Circular Economic Institute, related policy action, recommendations and pilot training certificate development offer consideration for moving into a more sustainable future. Introduction A Circular Economy (CE) stands opposite our current linear economy in which we manufacture, buy, use, and waste or discard products. Circularity proposes a fundamental change to this structure and presents a model in which products are manufactured for more environmentally regenerative purposes to extend their lifecycle. This may be done with intentional design for reuse, repair, and recycling. Leading this effort globally, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a non-profit organization that helps develop and promote the concepts 2 of circular economics and how scarcity informs the collective futures on the planet with regard to climate change challenges and issues as well as biodiversity loss (About Us: What We Do, n.d.). As such, the Foundation identifies three key impacts that are also functional goals of CE as (1) eliminating waste and pollution, (2) circulating products and materials, and (3) regenerating nature. In defining CE, it is important to note that it is distinct in language from other modern concepts, such as sustainability. As an example, while sustainability is close in relation to circularity (and at times argued to be interchangeable), that is but one aspect of the overarching concept. Sustainability is typically considered to be an environmental and social goal of maintenance. While this is more positive than depletion, ultimately, it does nothing to replace or reinvest in precious resources. Instead, CE offers a more holistic working model that does involve sustainability within design, but also includes sharing, leasing, and/or recycling at the level of consumption, and environmental solidarity. As climate change and pollution become an ever more pressing issue in our current world, citizens demand action from governments and the private sector. Production of material items continues to increase in proportion to demand. One of the most drastic increases in production and consumption can be viewed through industry, such as plastics and polymer production. Plastic production has increased since 1950 from approximately two million tons to current levels of output at approximately 450 million tons in 2023 (Ritchie, 2023). Additionally, the world generates 2.01 billion tons of municipal solid waste (or MSW) each year. This number is projected to nearly double to 3.4 billion in a few decades (Filipenco, 2023). Notably, extraction of nonrenewable raw materials has also tripled in the last four decades as Earth’s population has rapidly increased according to the United Nations Environment Programme (2019). It is clear that continuing on this trajectory would be disastrous for the environment, however, leadership at the global level and collaboration amongst nations may support the transition from a linear to a more circular economy. As an example, it is possible to decrease the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere due to the reduction of extraction of raw materials. This is projected to reduce the impact of climate change on our planet (Climate Change and the Circular Economy | NC DEQ, n.d.). As countries become aware of and incorporate components of circularity, a wave of new supportive policies have been introduced. The body of this document will focus on those relevant to small and medium-sized businesses and related activities within the state of Michigan – including learning and skill-building opportunities. Within the United States specifically, small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) employ nearly 46% of the workforce and account for approximately 43.5% of the national GDP (Ferguson & Lucy, 2023; Main, 2024). According to the federal Small Business Administration (and variable by industry and number of employees), small businesses typically employ fewer than 100 employees up to 500, and mid-sized business at 100 to 900 employees. This is also demonstrable by annual receipts and revenues. To help put this in perspective, that is approximately 32,540,953 small businesses composing 99.9% of all firms in the U.S. In comparison, large business (about 20,516) have also created some 7.9 million jobs whereas small 3 business is responsible for about 12.7 million jobs according to the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy (2024). For additional information regarding the definition of small and mid-sized businesses, please see the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Officeof Advocacy (2024). In Michigan, SMBs account for 48.3% of Michigan commerce (Whitmer Announces New Data Showing Record Small Business Growth, 2022). However, Michigan’s workforce (as of December, 2023) associated with SMBs accounted for about 62.2% (Michigan Jobless Rate Remains Unchanged in December, 2024). This contributes $675 billion to the state’s GDP (USAFacts, 2023). Transitioning to more circular practices offers a unique opportunity for SMBs and entrepreneurs to reduce operating costs and improve their production and sales efficiency. Continuing education such as professional development or certification training in circularity will be critical to successful transition. While entrepreneurs and SMBs may likely be challenged by the incorporation of circular practice in the short-term, the cost-effectiveness of these practices in the long run will determine if this paradigm shift truly takes root. Additionally, while transnational enterprise and conglomerates may be able to pivot and afford, for example, sourcing and production shifts along their supply chain, it is unlikely all necessary components (including financial capital and procurement support) will be available and/or readily accessible for smaller entities. To highlight this opportunity, faculty and research assistants at Michigan State University are working to investigate, develop, disseminate and ultimately evaluate supportive SMB transitional practices. Background Currently, only about 8.6% of global materials are cycled back into the economy worldwide (""Circularity Gap Report 2020"", 2020). This low rate of material recycling is due, in part, to the take-make-waste model that does not focus on regeneration nor reduction of waste. However, this circularity gap may be reduced as discussed through this summarization of circular efforts such as the increase of materials recycled. Many policies and practices foster global collaboration to collect and share data, translate global trends into national pathways, and build global coalition for action that is both diverse and inclusive (""Circularity Gap Report 2020"", 2020). The United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) to date have led the promotion of sustainable and circular-specific practices. In 2015, the UN introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted on January 1, 2016 with the overarching goal of reaching “peace and prosperity” by 2030. The EU has also worked to embrace a more circular economy as documented in their Circular Economy Plan adopted in 2021 (Circular Economy Action Plan, n.d.). Building on this, the EU released “A New Circular Economy Action Plan” in the summer of 2023 providing a pathway forward (European Commission, 2023). Of significant consequence, it was found that 80% of a product’s environmental impact is deliberated at the design phase (European Commission, 2023). 4 Jointly, other countries in partnership with the UN have also developed collaborative projects such as 2CIRCULAR. This working project is functionally implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in partnership with the Ministries of Industry, Economy & Trade, Environment, and Finance and the Association of the Lebanese Industrialists (ALI) with the support of the Federation of the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (FCCIAL). As such, this program aims to advance investment into resource efficiency and cleaner production to reduce the costs of production (EU Invests 3.7 Million Euro to Support Green and Circular Economy in Lebanon Through a Project Implemented by UNIDO, n.d.). With boots on the ground in Lebanon, 2CIRCULAR facilitates a shift of more than 50 food and beverage companies towards circular modeling. Building on past success, UNIDO previously supported 15 Lebanese companies and today works to triple this through 2CIRCULAR – affecting not only EU sourcing and trade, but also the Mideast. Regulation efforts through legislation and collaboration span from Western European countries to Southeast Asia. Multinational efforts such as Green Public Procurement (GPP) have been adopted by Germany, Japan, Korea, Austria, France, and Iceland with mandatory requirements and targets (OECD 2023). International law affecting countries with GPP requirements also include Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, and Portugal. An official “UN observer”, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) leads GPP research and advocacy working for standardization internationally. Beginning with its “Green Growth Strategy” in 2009, this organization attempts to stimulate economic growth and development “while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our well-being relies” (OECD 2023). These efforts continue to be updated and policy recommendations revised as circular modeling continues to emerge alongside climate-related and public health challenges. Promoting circular economic transition and practice nationally, France and the Netherlands demonstrate global leadership. France’s effort includes being the first to ban leftover/unsold food disposal as well as policies requiring companies to reuse, donate, or recycle food remains. Commitment to regenerative practices was also demonstrated with President Macron’s signature enabling the Anti-Waste Law in 2020 (France’s Anti-waste and Circular Economy Law, 2022rea). Other activities include being the first country to adopt a mandatory repairability index on electronics. This index is a first-of-its-kind ranking of how environmentally friendly electric appliances are based on criteria such as availability of spare parts, how easy it is to deconstruct and reassemble, et cetera (Remarks on the French draft Decree and Orders on the durability index of electrical and electronic equipment, 2023). In 2022, the French also reported their early warning assessment of progress made towards achieving 2025 goals for municipal and packaging waste. This innovative early warning assessment measures not only MSW, but also climate-related risks in working towards their Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC targeting recycling and preparing for reuse of 55% of municipal waste generated by 2025 (Early Warning Assessment Related to the 2025 Targets for Municipal Waste and Packaging Waste, 2022). As of Spring 2024, such legislation and action is 5 set to become widespread and every French household will be provided with a solution for sorting its food waste and other biodegradable natural waste. The Netherlands is another leading country taking action to promote circular economies. The Dutch intend to reach complete circularity by 2050 with the first step towards reducing raw material use by 50% by 2030 (Government of the Netherlands 2016). Five target points have been prioritized, including 1) biomass/food, 2) plastics, 3) consumer goods, 4) the manufacturing industry, and 5) the construction sector according to the constitutional monarchy (Government of the Netherlands, 2016). Every two years the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency monitors and evaluates this progress offering the bi-annual Circular Economy Progress Report. As of 2022, the Report identifies the Netherlands as 24.5% circular with area to improve outside of material efficiency (Circular Economy Progress Report 2022, 2022). Additionally, the report notes policy intensification is required to enable a more government-wide and multi-faceted approach that offers strategy beyond recycling. Also of note, the City of Amsterdam has committed to becoming its own circular economy, wasting nothing and recycling everything by 2050. Here, Circle Economy – an international team based in Amsterdam – has recently become a global impact organization due to their work crafting a vision for an economic system that ensures the planet, and all people, can thrive (20220602 - CJI - III-Evidence to Action - 210x297mm.pdf, n.d.). In doing so, they have partnered with over 20 different nations to promote circularity. With a priority goal of doubling global circularity by 2032, their flagship efforts through the Circular Jobs Initiative works to ensure a transition to a circular economy will be a positive event(s) for those workforces and innovations enabling it. According to their Amsterdam Circular 2020- 2025 Strategy report, current understanding of circular economics fails to address primary issues of global social inequalities caused by both assumption and oversight according to the Municipality of Amsterdam (2020). Due to the emerging, complex and interconnected nature of circularity, new educational programs are also in development across the world. Through anecdotal research and observation, it is found that many programs are geared toward leadership, workforce skill development and operations management. Of note, the University of Cambridge offers premier courses on Circular Economy and Sustainability Strategies. This 6-week online program offers an overview of circular economies as well as sustainability strategies. “It is designed to help understand the growing business for sustainable solutions and learn how to manage and grow a business by incorporating circular economy principles into strategy” (Sustainability Strategies Online Course | Cambridge Judge Business School, n.d.). Additionally, more EU learning opportunities are available through entities such as the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform and the Circular Economy Institute – a joint initiative by the European Commission and the European Economic and Social Committee. As America also implements stronger environmental regulation and new incentives for circular activity, U.S. training and technical support for transition will be required. 6 International Circular Practice Highlights From the Food and Agriculture Sector According to the World Bank (2022), “about 80% of the global population most at risk from crop failures and hunger from climate change are located within Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, where farming families are disproportionally poor and vulnerable. According to the interview series produced by the World Bank Group: Climate Change (2022) “Climate Explainer Series”, William R. Sutton, Global Lead for Climate Smart Agriculture for the World Bank shared critical information regarding food security and climate change. During this interview, he noted that the number of people suffering from acute food insecurity increased from 135 million in 2019 to 345 million in 2022 – an increase of almost 40%. Simultaneously it is estimated that the global food system is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions – second only to the energy sector; it is also the number one source of methane and biodiversity loss. However, transitioning to more sustainable and ultimately circular practices has strong potential to slow the use of finite natural resources, reduce landscape and habitat loss, and limit biodiversity loss. Efforts on the international scale to implement more circular practice have been underway in the recent past with particular emphasis on sustainability. Citing examples of this, the paper “Quiet Revolution by SMEs in the Midstream of Value Chains in Developing Regions: wholesale markets, wholesalers, logistics & processing” by Reardon et al. (2021) observes how small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and value chains have developed across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The authors cite midstream SMEs as accounting for roughly 65% of the food supply in Africa and South Asia. Necessary to ensure food security, SMEs have an important role in food availability, inclusive food access, and food utilization. They also make the important point that “commercialization-induced intensification may induce excessive use of pesticides and fertilizer with attendant pollution of rivers and groundwater or siltation from aquaculture and effluents of manure from pork and poultry production” as observed in South Asia. Lastly, they state that farmers in Africa are directly affected by wholesale SMEs (both public and private) through farm profit and productivity inputs like fertilizer or soil conservation items (Reardon et al., 2021). Today, electronic platforms also provide information about food resources and both sustainable and regenerative practices. One highlighted example of this is the “Olio” platform, beginning as an initiative to end food waste, and already utilized by more than seven million people worldwide, most notably in the UK, U.S., Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Namibia (Our Story | Olio, 2023). Olio connects neighbors and allows them to offer up and request leftover food helping to prevent household food waste. Headed by Tessa Clarke and Sasha Celestial-One, Olio partners with restaurants, caterers, and hotels. These partners are projected

The traditional business model of selling products as discrete units is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Across industries, companies are shifting away from one-time product sales toward ongoing service relationships where customers pay for the outcomes and value delivered rather than for ownership of physical assets. This evolution, known as Product-as-a-Service (PaaS), represents more than a pricing strategy adjustment; it constitutes a comprehensive reimagining of the provider-customer relationship, value creation mechanisms, and organizational structures.

The concept of Product-as-a-Service merges the physical dimension of products with the intangible qualities of service delivery, creating hybrid offerings that can generate continuous revenue streams while addressing evolving customer expectations for flexibility, personalization, and sustainability. For businesses, PaaS models promise greater predictability in revenue, deeper customer relationships, and valuable data insights that feed back into product development and service optimization. For customers, these models offer access over ownership, reduced capital expenditure, and solutions better aligned with their actual needs.

This transition from selling products to providing services has accelerated in recent years, driven by digital transformation, increased connectivity, environmental pressures, and shifting consumer preferences. The Internet of Things (IoT), advanced analytics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence have created the technological foundation that makes PaaS viable across an expanding range of sectors, from manufacturing and healthcare to transportation and consumer goods.

This article explores the multifaceted nature of Product-as-a-Service transformations, examining the drivers behind this shift, the various models that have emerged, and the challenges and opportunities they present. Through an analysis of diverse case studies from around the world, we will investigate how organizations across different industries have implemented PaaS strategies, the metrics they use to measure success, and the lessons they have learned. By understanding these dynamics, businesses can better navigate their own journeys toward service-oriented models and position themselves for success in an increasingly servitized economy.

### Understanding Product-as-a-Service: Concepts and Evolution

### Defining Product-as-a-Service

Product-as-a-Service represents a business model innovation where companies offer integrated packages of products and services designed to deliver specific outcomes or functionalities to customers, typically through subscription or usage-based payment arrangements rather than outright purchase. This transformation fundamentally alters the relationship between provider and customer from a transactional, ownership-focused interaction to an ongoing partnership centered on value delivery over time.

At its core, PaaS involves a reconfiguration of the traditional value proposition. Instead of transferring ownership of a product to customers, companies retain ownership of the physical assets while providing customers with access to the functionality, outcomes, or experiences those assets enable. Revenue is generated not through one-time sales but through recurring payment streams tied to usage, performance, or availability of the service.

The PaaS model encompasses several related concepts that are sometimes used interchangeably but have distinct nuances:

1. Servitization: The broader strategic process by which manufacturing companies add services to their product offerings, evolving from product-focused to service-focused business models.
2. Product-Service Systems (PSS): Integrated combinations of products and services that together fulfill specific customer needs.
3. Functional Sales: Business models where customers pay for the function or performance of a product rather than the product itself.
4. Performance-Based Contracting: Agreements where payment is tied to the achievement of specific performance outcomes.
5. Outcome-Based Services: Services where providers commit to delivering particular customer outcomes rather than specific activities or outputs.

What unites these concepts is the fundamental shift in focus from what a product is to what it does for the customer. This represents a profound reorientation of business strategy, organizational capabilities, and customer relationships.

### Historical Evolution of PaaS

The transition from product-centric to service-centric business models has been gradual, with early examples emerging decades ago in specific sectors. Understanding this evolution provides important context for the current acceleration of PaaS adoption.

The origins of PaaS can be traced back to the 1960s with companies like Rolls-Royce pioneering ""power-by-the-hour"" contracts for aircraft engines, where airlines paid for engine uptime rather than purchasing the engines outright. Similarly, Xerox's shift from selling photocopiers to providing document management services represented an early example of servitization.

The 1990s saw increased academic interest in the concept, with researchers like Sandra Vandermerwe and Juan Rada introducing the term ""servitization"" to describe manufacturers' movement toward service provision. During this period, companies like IBM underwent significant transformations, pivoting from hardware manufacturing to service-based business models.

The digital revolution of the early 2000s created new opportunities for PaaS models, with software-as-a-service (SaaS) emerging as a prominent example. Companies like Salesforce demonstrated the viability of subscription-based models for software, challenging the traditional licensing approach. This period also saw increased attention to environmental sustainability, with concepts like ""product stewardship"" and ""extended producer responsibility"" encouraging manufacturers to take greater responsibility for products throughout their lifecycle.

The convergence of several technological trends in the 2010s—including IoT, cloud computing, big data analytics, and mobile connectivity—accelerated the adoption of PaaS models. These technologies enabled real-time monitoring of product performance, usage-based billing, remote maintenance, and continuous improvement based on data insights. Companies like Philips (with Lighting-as-a-Service) and Michelin (with tire management services) demonstrated how traditional manufacturers could successfully transform their business models.

Today, PaaS has evolved beyond isolated examples to become a mainstream business strategy across diverse sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this shift by highlighting the resilience of service-based revenue streams during economic disruption and by catalyzing digital transformation initiatives across industries.

### Theoretical Frameworks for Understanding PaaS

Several theoretical perspectives help explain the shift toward PaaS models and provide frameworks for analyzing their implementation:

1. Service-Dominant Logic: Introduced by Vargo and Lusch, this perspective suggests that service—the application of specialized competencies for the benefit of another entity—is the fundamental basis of economic exchange. Products are merely distribution mechanisms for service provision. This framework helps explain why companies are increasingly focusing on the service dimensions of their offerings rather than the physical products themselves.
2. Resource-Based View: This theory posits that firms gain competitive advantage through valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable resources. In PaaS models, competitive advantage often derives from unique combinations of product knowledge, service capabilities, and customer relationships rather than from products alone.
3. Transaction Cost Economics: This perspective examines the relative efficiency of different governance structures (markets, hierarchies, and hybrids) for managing transactions. PaaS models often create hybrid structures between markets and hierarchies, reducing certain transaction costs for customers (such as maintenance and disposal) while creating new coordination mechanisms.
4. Business Model Innovation: This area of research examines how companies create, deliver, and capture value. PaaS represents a fundamental innovation in all three aspects of business models—rethinking value proposition (outcomes vs. products), value creation (ongoing service vs. one-time manufacturing), and value capture (recurring revenue vs. one-time sales).

These theoretical frameworks provide valuable lenses for understanding the complexities of PaaS transformations and can guide organizations in designing and implementing effective service-based business models.

### Drivers of the Product-as-a-Service Transformation

The shift toward Product-as-a-Service models is being propelled by a confluence of technological, economic, environmental, and social forces. Understanding these drivers provides insight into why PaaS is gaining momentum across industries and regions.

### Technological Enablers

Technology has been the primary catalyst for the feasibility and scalability of PaaS models. Several key technological developments have converged to create the foundation for this business model transformation:

1. Internet of Things (IoT): The proliferation of connected sensors and devices enables continuous monitoring of product performance, usage patterns, and maintenance needs. This real-time visibility provides the data foundation for usage-based billing, predictive maintenance, and performance optimization. For example, agricultural equipment manufacturer John Deere uses IoT sensors in its machinery to offer predictive maintenance services and optimization recommendations to farmers.
2. Cloud Computing: Cloud infrastructure provides the scalable computing power and storage capabilities necessary to process and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by connected products. It also enables the delivery of software components of PaaS offerings through web-based interfaces accessible from anywhere. Companies like Microsoft have leveraged cloud capabilities to transform from software vendors to service providers through their Azure platform.
3. Advanced Analytics and Artificial Intelligence: These technologies allow companies to derive actionable insights from product usage data, enabling personalization, optimization, and prediction. Predictive analytics can anticipate maintenance needs before failures occur, while machine learning algorithms can continuously improve service quality based on accumulated data. GE Aviation's use of analytics for its aircraft engine monitoring service exemplifies this approach.
4. Mobile Technology: Smartphones and tablets have created ubiquitous interfaces through which customers can access, control, and derive value from PaaS offerings. Mobile apps serve as control panels for everything from home thermostats to industrial equipment, facilitating convenient service delivery and customer engagement.
5. Digital Platforms: Platform technologies enable efficient matching of supply and demand, creating new possibilities for asset sharing and service delivery. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have demonstrated how platforms can transform traditional ownership models into service-based alternatives.
6. Blockchain and Smart Contracts: These emerging technologies have the potential to automate and secure payment processes in PaaS models, particularly for usage-based or outcome-based contracts where verification of performance is critical.
7. Digital Twin Technology: Creating virtual replicas of physical products enables simulation, monitoring, and optimization of performance in real-time, enhancing the service component of PaaS offerings. Siemens uses digital twins in its industrial services to optimize customer operations.

The synergistic combination of these technologies has dramatically reduced the barriers to implementing PaaS models, making it feasible for companies to maintain connections with their products throughout the lifecycle and deliver continuous value to customers.

### Economic Drivers

Beyond technological enablers, powerful economic forces are pushing businesses toward PaaS models:

1. Revenue Stability and Predictability: Subscription and usage-based revenue models generate more predictable cash flows compared to the cyclical nature of product sales. This stability is particularly valuable during economic downturns, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic when companies with recurring revenue streams showed greater resilience.
2. Increased Customer Lifetime Value: PaaS models typically extend the duration of customer relationships, increasing the total revenue generated from each customer over time. Adobe's transition from selling packaged software to a subscription-based Creative Cloud offering exemplifies this benefit, with significant increases in customer lifetime value.
3. Margin Enhancement: Services typically command higher profit margins than physical products, especially in mature industries where product commoditization has eroded margins. By integrating services with products, companies can differentiate their offerings and capture greater value.
4. Asset Efficiency: When providers retain ownership of assets under PaaS models, they can optimize asset utilization across multiple customers, potentially serving more customers with fewer total assets. Mobility-as-a-Service offerings like car-sharing services demonstrate this efficiency.
5. Competitive Differentiation: In markets where product features are increasingly similar, service components provide opportunities for meaningful differentiation based on customer experience and outcomes. Caterpillar's CAT Connect services differentiate the company from competitors selling similar heavy equipment.
6. Barriers to Competition: Successful PaaS offerings often involve complex ecosystems of products, services, and partnerships that are difficult for competitors to replicate. These ecosystems create switching costs for customers and barriers to entry for potential competitors.
7. Capital Expenditure to Operating Expenditure Shift: For customers, PaaS models transform large upfront capital investments into more manageable operational expenses, making sophisticated solutions accessible to a broader market. This shift has been particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises seeking access to advanced technologies.

These economic factors create compelling business cases for both providers and customers, driving the accelerating adoption of PaaS models.

### Environmental and Sustainability Drivers

Environmental concerns and sustainability imperatives are increasingly influential in shaping business model innovation:

1. Circular Economy Principles: PaaS models align with circular economy concepts by incentivizing design for durability, repairability, and end-of-life recovery. When manufacturers retain ownership of products, they have stronger incentives to design for multiple lifecycle iterations and efficient resource use.
2. Extended Producer Responsibility: Regulatory frameworks in many regions are placing greater responsibility on manufacturers for the entire lifecycle of their products. PaaS models, where producers maintain control over products, facilitate compliance with these requirements.
3. Resource Efficiency: By optimizing product use across multiple customers and extending product lifespans through maintenance and remanufacturing, PaaS models can reduce the total resources consumed relative to traditional ownership models. Philips' Circular Lighting service, for instance, reduces material use by maintaining and upgrading lighting systems rather than replacing them.
4. Carbon Footprint Reduction: The focus on outcomes rather than physical assets can lead to dematerialization and reduced environmental impacts. Mobility-as-a-Service offerings that reduce the need for personal vehicle ownership exemplify this potential.
5. Sustainability Reporting Requirements: As organizations face increasing pressure to report on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, PaaS models offer opportunities to demonstrate concrete actions toward sustainability goals.

The growing urgency of climate change and resource constraints will likely intensify these drivers in the coming years, further accelerating the adoption of PaaS approaches.

### Social and Consumer Preference Shifts

Changes in consumer attitudes and social trends are creating fertile ground for PaaS models:

1. Access Over Ownership: Younger generations in particular are showing greater interest in accessing products when needed rather than owning them outright. This preference shift has been observed across categories from cars to clothing to digital media.
2. Experience Economy: Consumers increasingly value experiences over material possessions, creating opportunities for service-based models that focus on delivering experiences rather than transferring ownership of products.
3. Customization and Personalization Demands: Modern consumers expect offerings tailored to their specific needs and preferences—a requirement more easily met through service-based models that can adapt over time based on usage data and feedback.
4. Simplification and Convenience: As lives become busier and more complex, consumers value solutions that reduce cognitive load and simplify decision-making. PaaS offerings that handle maintenance, upgrades, and other ownership responsibilities address this need.
5. Professional Procurement Evolution: Even in business-to-business contexts, procurement professionals are increasingly evaluating vendors based on total cost of ownership and value delivered rather than purchase price alone, creating openness to outcome-based contracts and service agreements.
6. Collaborative Consumption: Social trends toward sharing, collaboration, and community-based consumption align with the shared access models that characterize many PaaS offerings.

These social and consumer shifts create market demand for PaaS offerings, complementing the technological enablers and economic incentives driving businesses toward these models.

### Typology of Product-as-a-Service Models

Product-as-a-Service encompasses a spectrum of business models, each representing different degrees of servitization and different balances between product and service components. Understanding this typology helps organizations identify which approach best aligns with their capabilities and market opportunities.

### Product-Oriented Services

At the early stages of servitization, product-oriented services maintain a focus on product sales while adding complementary services that enhance the product's value:

1. Product Extension Services: Basic services that extend the functionality or lifespan of products after sale, such as warranties, maintenance plans, and technical support. These services are typically sold separately from the product itself. For example, Apple's AppleCare service plans extend warranty coverage and technical support for its devices.
2. Product Advice and Consulting: Services that help customers select, implement, and use products more effectively. John Deere offers agronomic advice services alongside its agricultural equipment, helping farmers optimize equipment usage for specific crops and conditions.
3. Product Training Services: Educational services that teach customers how to use products efficiently and effectively. Cisco provides extensive training services to help customers maximize the value of their networking equipment.
4. Add-on Services: Optional enhancements that add functionality to the base product. Tesla's Full Self-Driving Capability is offered as an add-on service to its vehicles, with continuous updates improving functionality over time.

Product-oriented services represent a relatively modest departure from traditional product sales models. The product remains the core of the offering, with services designed to support and enhance the product experience. Revenue still comes primarily from product sales, with services generating supplementary income streams.

### Use-Oriented Services

Moving further along the servitization spectrum, use-oriented services shift the focus from product ownership to product access and usage:

1. Product Leasing: Customers gain exclusive access to products for defined periods, paying regular fees rather than purchasing outright. While customers don't own the assets, they typically assume many of the responsibilities of ownership during the lease period. Commercial aircraft leasing exemplifies this model,

Relevant Content: These models also increase customer loyalty, as customers may return to the same business for repeated rentals, maintenance, or upgrades while also providing access to new customer segments who are interested in using but not owning certain products. Moreover, PaaS business models can help to achieve climate strategy and sustainability goals – a company using a PaaS model meets more customer demand with less products, which in turn decreases waste and increase its resource efficiency. The product’s embodied lifecycle footprint and emissions-per-use will decrease, resulting in a decreased impact on climate, biodiversity, and natural resource extraction.

## Determining the PaaS model that is right for your business [...] There are different product attributes that lend themselves well to certain PaaS models over others. Outlined below are four different types of PaaS models that vary based on the degree of ownership, control, and responsibility that a company and its customers have over the product. [...] In this first installment of our Circular Business Model series, we will explore the concept of 'Product-as-a-Service' (PaaS) – a circular solution that offers new ways for customers to access or use a product, rather than the traditional ownership model. PaaS is an innovative business model that disrupts the long-standing practice of one-time sales transactions for physical goods. It instead increases a product’s utility and value by extending its use phase, increasing lifetime revenue and resource efficiency, and reducing waste. This model benefits both businesses and customers, as businesses can use PaaS to increase revenue per item produced, generate new revenue streams, and increase customer loyalty, while also extending a product’s lifespan and reducing its environmental impact.

# Circular Business Model Innovation: Product-as-a-Service

How Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) can unlock new revenue streams and increase customer satisfaction

Share

In this first installment of our Circular Business Model series, we will explore the concept of 'Product-as-a-Service' (PaaS) – a circular solution that offers new ways for customers to access or use a product, rather than the traditional ownership model. PaaS is an innovative business model that disrupts the long-standing practice of one-time sales transactions for physical goods. It instead increases a product’s utility and value by extending its use phase, increasing lifetime revenue and resource efficiency, and reducing waste. This model benefits both businesses and customers, as businesses can use PaaS to increase revenue per item produced, generate new revenue streams, and increase customer loyalty, while also extending a product’s lifespan and reducing its environmental impact. Customers can benefit by gaining access to products and services at a lower cost and under more flexible and convenient terms, without having to purchase or own the product outright and be responsible for its storage and maintenance.

## What is Product-as-a-service?

Imagine a fashion enthusiast who loves to wear new outfits every week. Continuously buying new clothes can be expensive and wasteful, especially when only worn once or twice. What if this customer could rent the clothes instead, and return them after use? This is the idea behind the clothing and accessory rental companies that have become popular with customers, as they allow customers to access a diverse wardrobe without owning it and provide convenient and hassle-free services that include dry cleaning, delivery, and insurance.

These clothing rental companies are leveraging a PaaS business model, where businesses offer the use of or access to their products on a service basis rather than selling them as individual items for customers to own. There are generally four types of ways to offer your product as a service: renting, leasing, pay-per-use, and product subscriptions.

Central to all PaaS business models is the concept of asset utilization, which measures how efficiently a product is used to generate income. The more uses of a product by customers, the higher its asset utilization and the lower its unit cost. A PaaS model can increase asset utilization by renting, leasing or providing access to a fixed

Driven by a myriad of factors such as digitalisation, a burgeoning global middle class, and exponential innovation, demand across various segments such as consumer electronics, ICT, industrial and medical electronics, and automotive electronics are higher than ever before. This increase in demand coupled with the current predominance of linear business models within the electronics industry give rise to a potentially significant increase in negative environmental impacts.
Electronics are associated with a high demand for raw materials and substantial energy use during the manufacturing process. Electronics consumption follows a pattern of short usage periods and premature end-of-life. Furthermore, improper control over material flows has led to the growing environmental issue of electronic waste. We believe there is a clear business case for circularity within the electronics industry, with clear indications that circular electronics can help ameliorate these problems while Executive summary generating value both from a climate and cost effictiveness perspective. Based on this we have made an attempt to quantify this value, and help provide further evidence for the merit of adopting circularity within electronics.
A linear model, rather than a circular one, is dominating today’s electronics industry which is associated with a wide range of environmental, social and economic problems along the value chain. Transitioning to a circular economy presents a solution to many of the challenges facing the industry without diminishing the positive impacts of electronics on business and consumers. In this context, it is relevant to point out that the electronics sector is highly responsible for emitted greenhouse gases in all stages of the electronics’s life cycle. Currently, the electronics industry is responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, roughly equivalent to the global footprint of the fashion industry. PwC | Future Proofing the Electronics Industry: The case for circular business models 5 Circular economy Today’s linear economy follows the take-make-waste principle, which is characterised by sequential stages of resource extraction, production, consumption, and disposal. It is a concept that describes the linear progression of materials and products through these stages, ultimately leading to their end as waste. It is a principle that shows systematic flaws of the linear economy: it is wasteful, harmful and costly. It involves energy, labour, embodied carbon emissions and other resources to create the final goods that will be in use for only a relatively short time.
Linearity, in many cases results in inefficient disposal methods that are environmentally harmful, leading to pollution, resource depletion, and negative impacts on ecosystems and human health.
To address the challenges associated with the linear economy, a transition to a circular economy is imperative. The circular economy aims to maximise resource efficiency, design out waste, and promote the reuse, recycling, and refurbishment of products. Circularity follows principles that want to restore natural capital and is inspired by systems thinking with the act of designing products, business models and systems in such a way that economic activity is decoupled from the consumption and destruction of finite resources and nature.
The circular economy is not just about resource efficiency and decoupling, but also about mitigating climate change by an absolute reduction of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. The circular economy is expected to have many co-benefits that enable sustainable development in the fields of climate change, natural capital and biodiversity. A series of transitions are needed to realise benefits We present, in this report, the results of our analysis, produced after nearly a year of research & collaboration both across the firm and with external parties, where we have attempted to quantify the climate and financial benefits of moving towards a more circular business model. We have done so using the electronics industry as a case study, but we believe that nearly all industries have some potential for realising the value of transitioning to more circular business models. Our model has evaluated three different circular business models across four different segments in the electronics industry, and found that different strategies excel across different segments, depending on if the business in question is seeking to optimise for cost reduction or environmental impact, but our key finding is that all circular business models (circular inputs, remanufacturing and PaaS) analysed in this report prove more cost effective and significantly reduce CO2e compared to using linear model (business as usual) approach over the next 12 years.

Within each segment, we found that product-as-a-service and remanufacturing stood out as the best strategies across consumer electronics, industrial electronics, and ICT, depending on whether one aims to optimise for cost or CO2e reduction. Within automotive electronics, we found remanufacturing to be the best, as using PaaS at an electronic component level was deemed unfeasible for most actors in the segment at the time of this study. Nevertheless, it’s important to acknowledge that each of these three circular business models requires an initial investment and business transformation. Even apparently straightforward actions, like gradually implementing an enhanced circular input strategy, can yield valuable results and does not require a huge operational or strategic change. Then, as a company matures in its work with circularity, they can gradually move towards more sophisticated business models until circularity is fully embedded in the business strategy, including those not covered by this report. Moreover, the strategies in practice are often not viewed and implemented in silos but can be implemented in combination to one another. For example, higher cost and CO2e savings can be achieved through having circular inputs of products in the manufacturing phase and having a PaaS model during the use phase.
There are several factors that encourage companies within the electronics space to pursue circularity aside from those the model has considered, including digitalisation as a driver of business model implementation and increasing resource efficiency, potential partnerships which might provide valuable synergy, as well as a burgeoning regulatory push for circularity. But there are also challenges, such as the aforementioned initial investment and/or business transformation required. However, while we acknowledge the challenges associated with transitioning to a more circular business model, we believe that there is a clear business case to be made for taking the leap, and plenty of value to be captured.

Circular inputs Product-as-a-service Circularity fully embedded in the business strategy Re-manufacturing PwC | Future Proofing the Electronics Industry: The case for circular business models 7 Introduction & Background Digitalisation, a burgeoning global middle class, and exponential innovation are driving a higher demand for electronics across segments than ever before. In the 21st century, technology and innovation play a crucial role in economic development by improving communications, enabling efficiency gains via automation, optimising resource allocation, and more. Driven by the expanding global connectivity and rapid economic growth in various economies, the demand for electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) continues to escalate. The proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and laptops is allowing an increasing number of people to access the internet, while a rising middle class contributes to the production and purchase of household appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, heating units, and flat panel televisions. Anticipated advancements in connectivity indicate a shift towards decentralised cloud data centres, reducing the reliance on local data centres and corporate IT equipment. Simultaneously, the consumer market for interconnected devices is expected to flourish, with the projected number of connected devices surpassing three times the global population by 2023.
The global electronics market is valued at $1275 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 7.5% with the Asia-Pacific and North America regions driving demand.1 However, an estimated 77 million tonnes of electronics were introduced to the global market as a result of this growth, with Asia consuming more than 50%, followed by the Americas (over 20%) and Europe (~18%).2 Increased linear EEE consumption has brought into focus the negative environmental and social externalities generated by the take-make-waste status quo. Negative externalities of particular concern to regulators and consumers include the contribution of CO2e emissions to anthropogenic climate change, short- and long-term health effects resulting from workplace incidents, and environmental and noise pollution for communities near extraction and production facilities.3 In 2019, only 17% of e-waste was documented to be collected and properly recycled globally, meaning that 44.3 million tonnes of raw materials conservatively valued at USD 57 billion were discarded in one year.4 In a linear scenario, recoverable high-value materials such as gold, silver, copper, and platinum are being dumped or incinerated instead of treated and reintroduced to the market. In addition to material loss, the improper management of electronic waste has led to the growth of a large informal recycling sector where hazardous practices like burning or dismantling electronics without proper safety measures are prevalent, resulting in disproportionate impacts on the people and environment in developing countries that take on the world’s waste.5 Transitioning to a circular economy presents a solution to many of the challenges the electronic industry faces without diminishing the positive impacts of electronics on business and consumers. Circular business models aim to create a product system that keeps resources at maximum use for as long as possible and that closes material loops so value is preserved in subsequent use cycles. Keeping materials in a closed loop minimises the negative externalities associated with resource extraction and end-of-life disposal, phases in a product’s life with some of the highest reported environmental and social impacts.6 Circularity is also an opportunity for the electronics industry to increase customer loyalty, net promoter scores, and to create a competitive advantage. Although there are many different circular business strategies, this report focuses on three key strategies hypothesised to have the highest savings potential in CO2e and cost within the industry: circular material inputs, remanufacturing, and products-as-a-service (PaaS).
Transitioning to a circular economy presents a solution to many of the challenges facing the industry without diminishing the positive impacts of electronics on business and consumers.
8 Prioritising circularity strategies As a way to prioritise between circular strategies, companies can refer to the commonly adopted view of the 9 circular strategies ranking where companies should strive to first utilise the strategies at the top of the list, and then make their way down.7 • Refuse - Is the product designed to fulfil multiple functions so customers are not required to buy different products? • Rethink - Can the company rethink the product to intensify its use? (ex: through sharing) • Reduce - Can the products be made more efficiently and/or can raw material inputs be reduced? • Reuse - Can the products and material be used again in or outside the company or by other users? How easy is it to recover value from my product?
• Repair - Can the product be easily repaired to extend its functional life? • Refurbish - Can the product be restored and old parts updated? • Remanufacture - Can the parts of an old product be reused in a new product with the same function? How easy is it to get my product back?
• Repurpose - At the end of its life, can the parts of an old product be used in a new product with a new function?
• Recycling - Can the materials of the product be recycled to make new products? PwC | Future Proofing the Electronics Industry: The case for circular business models 9 Circular business model definitions Circular material inputs Circular inputs or material substitution refers to the input of recycled and/or regenerative feedstocks into a product and it also includes the phasing out of toxic and/or hazardous materials. Circular inputs can include a wide range of materials, such as recycled plastics, metals, and glass, as well as renewable resources like bio-based materials and agricultural waste. Recycled materials are materials that have been processed or converted from waste or used products into new products with similar or different properties. This view on circular inputs also aligns with the Ellen McArthur Foundation’s view on regenerating loops which include eliminating the use of toxic substances, increasing the utilisation of renewable materials and energy and implementing net positive strategies that leaves the environment in a better state than before. Using more circular materials is a crucial step to reducing a product’s emissions. While the actual design phase of a product is often not the most carbon intensive, the decisions being made on the product components, how it will be used and manufactured can have a big impact on the other life cycle stages. Design is said to be at the heart of the circular economy since the decisions made at the design phase influences how long a product will last, what it is made of, if it can be repaired and what happens at the end-of-life. It is said that approximately 80% of a product’s environmental impact is influenced by decisions made at the design

Some of the most important drivers for remanufacturing are volatile supply and associated costs of raw materials due to increased natural disasters and geopolitical conflicts. To have an effective remanufacturing strategy, modular design has to be implemented when the products are being designed as if the

Driven by a myriad of factors such as digitalisation, a burgeoning global middle class, and exponential innovation, demand across various segments such as consumer electronics, ICT, industrial and medical electronics, and automotive electronics are higher than ever before. This increase in demand coupled with the current predominance of linear business models within the electronics industry give rise to a potentially significant increase in negative environmental impacts.
Electronics are associated with a high demand for raw materials and substantial energy use during the manufacturing process. Electronics consumption follows a pattern of short usage periods and premature end-of-life. Furthermore, improper control over material flows has led to the growing environmental issue of electronic waste. We believe there is a clear business case for circularity within the electronics industry, with clear indications that circular electronics can help ameliorate these problems while Executive summary generating value both from a climate and cost effictiveness perspective. Based on this we have made an attempt to quantify this value, and help provide further evidence for the merit of adopting circularity within electronics.
A linear model, rather than a circular one, is dominating today’s electronics industry which is associated with a wide range of environmental, social and economic problems along the value chain. Transitioning to a circular economy presents a solution to many of the challenges facing the industry without diminishing the positive impacts of electronics on business and consumers. In this context, it is relevant to point out that the electronics sector is highly responsible for emitted greenhouse gases in all stages of the electronics’s life cycle. Currently, the electronics industry is responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, roughly equivalent to the global footprint of the fashion industry. PwC | Future Proofing the Electronics Industry: The case for circular business models 5 Circular economy Today’s linear economy follows the take-make-waste principle, which is characterised by sequential stages of resource extraction, production, consumption, and disposal. It is a concept that describes the linear progression of materials and products through these stages, ultimately leading to their end as waste. It is a principle that shows systematic flaws of the linear economy: it is wasteful, harmful and costly. It involves energy, labour, embodied carbon emissions and other resources to create the final goods that will be in use for only a relatively short time.
Linearity, in many cases results in inefficient disposal methods that are environmentally harmful, leading to pollution, resource depletion, and negative impacts on ecosystems and human health.
To address the challenges associated with the linear economy, a transition to a circular economy is imperative. The circular economy aims to maximise resource efficiency, design out waste, and promote the reuse, recycling, and refurbishment of products. Circularity follows principles that want to restore natural capital and is inspired by systems thinking with the act of designing products, business models and systems in such a way that economic activity is decoupled from the consumption and destruction of finite resources and nature.
The circular economy is not just about resource efficiency and decoupling, but also about mitigating climate change by an absolute reduction of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. The circular economy is expected to have many co-benefits that enable sustainable development in the fields of climate change, natural capital and biodiversity. A series of transitions are needed to realise benefits We present, in this report, the results of our analysis, produced after nearly a year of research & collaboration both across the firm and with external parties, where we have attempted to quantify the climate and financial benefits of moving towards a more circular business model. We have done so using the electronics industry as a case study, but we believe that nearly all industries have some potential for realising the value of transitioning to more circular business models. Our model has evaluated three different circular business models across four different segments in the electronics industry, and found that different strategies excel across different segments, depending on if the business in question is seeking to optimise for cost reduction or environmental impact, but our key finding is that all circular business models (circular inputs, remanufacturing and PaaS) analysed in this report prove more cost effective and significantly reduce CO2e compared to using linear model (business as usual) approach over the next 12 years.

This view on circular inputs also aligns with the Ellen McArthur Foundation’s view on regenerating loops which include eliminating the use of toxic substances, increasing the utilisation of renewable materials and energy and implementing net positive strategies that leaves the environment in a better state than before. Using more circular materials is a crucial step to reducing a product’s emissions. While the actual design phase of a product is often not the most carbon intensive, the decisions being made on the product components, how it will be used and manufactured can have a big impact on the other life cycle stages. Design is said to be at the heart of the circular economy since the decisions made at the design phase influences how long a product will last, what it is made of, if it can be repaired and what happens at the end-of-life. It is said that approximately 80% of a product’s environmental impact is influenced by decisions made at the design

## Abstract

Transitioning to a circular economy is essential to decouple economic growth from resource consumption and ensure long-term competitiveness, especially in the European Union. Remanufacturing, a key strategy in this transition, involves reprocessing used products to meet or exceed original specifications, conserving resources, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing emissions. Despite its benefits, the integration of remanufacturing presents significant challenges, particularly on the shop floor, where uncertainties about the availability and quality of used products complicate processes. This paper develops a methodology for integrating remanufacturing into company operations, focusing on original equipment remanufacturers. Through practical insights derived from expert interviews, this work identifies key challenges and proposes a structured integration framework to support companies in adopting remanufacturing practices. The methodology emphasizes the operational aspects of introducing remanufacturing on the shop floor, addressing the needs of companies, and promoting the transition toward a circular economy.

Once the maximum value has been extracted, the resources are then recovered and reused, remanufactured, or recycled to create new products.
As a permanent material which can be recycled over and over again without losing its properties, steel is fundamental to the circular economy. The industry is continuing to expand its offer of advanced high-strength steels which reduce the weight of applications, and encourage circular economy practices. For society the benefits include durable products, local jobs, reduced emissions, and the conservation of raw materials for future generations.

Whether it is for transport systems, infrastructure, housing, manufacturing, agriculture, or energy, steel is a vital material in our modern world. In the sustainable future, new economic models will maximise the value of raw materials by encouraging practices such as reuse and remanufacturing. The weight of many steel products will be reduced, losses will be minimised, and the already high recycling rate for steel will increase, resulting in more recycled steel to make new steel products. Pre-consumer recycling from the steelmaking and manufacturing processes will decrease due to increased process efficiencies and collaboration between steelmakers and their customers to reduce yield losses.
5 3% Electrical equipment 11% Metal products 16% Mechanical equipment 13% Automotive 5% Domestic appliances 2% Other transport 50% Building and infrastructure Short service life Medium service life Long service life Steel markets and durability Around 650 million tonnes of recycled steel were utilised in the past year to create new steel. But it was not enough to satisfy the world’s demand for this essential metal. The main reason we still need to make steel from raw materials is the durability of steel products in combination with growth in steel demand. Steel products are durable and simply last a long time. In applications with a long service life, such as buildings and infrastructure, we will need to wait a hundred years or more to recycle the steel they contain. But every piece of steel can eventually be recycled to meet the growing global need for new steel.
STEEL IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR MODERN WORLD Steel use 2014 1,543 Mt 6 7 Since 1900 the global steel industry has recycled over 22 billion tonnes of steel. This has reduced iron ore consumption by around 28 billion tonnes, as well as cutting coal consumption by 14 billion tonnes 2.
The industry has also dramatically reduced the use of energy. Producing one tonne of steel today requires just 40% of the energy it did in 1960 3. Over the same period, steel production has increased almost five times.
Waste is another area in which the steel industry has made huge gains over the past decades. Working with external partners, the industry has been able to find markets for over 97% of its production with only a 2.7% waste stream 4. The valuable by-products, including slag, dust, and process gases are fully utilised in other applications and industries (see page 13 for examples), avoiding the use of primary materials such as cement clinker.
One area that the steel industry and its customers are working hard to improve is reducing the yield loss in downstream manufacturing processes. A common drive to diminish the percentage of offcuts, which are then re-melted to make new steel, will lead to greater productivity as well as energy and resource savings.
Over the past 50 years, the steel industry has invested in research and technology to create new grades of advanced and ultra-high-strength steels. These grades have reduced the weight of many steel applications by up to 40%. Optimising the weight of products is an integral part of a circular economy.
By reducing weight, the amount of raw materials and energy used to create the product is decreased, reducing pressure on raw materials. Lighter weight applications which take advantage of high-strength steels, such as vehicles, also produce fewer emissions during the use phase of their life. In construction, substituting high-strength steels for regular steels can achieve a CO2 reduction of around 30% in steel columns and around 20% in steel beams 1. Whether it is a wind turbine, construction panel, a vehicle, or a steel can, the application of high-strength steels means that less steel is required to provide the same strength and functionality. This also has a knock-on effect by reducing the amount of other materials required, for example in foundations. In addition, the development of better coating systems results in an extended service life and hence reduced material demand.
At the same time, the steel industry has reduced its dependence on raw materials. Decreasing the amount of material, energy and other resources used to create steel and reducing the weight of steel used in products.
REDUCE 8 CASE STUDY › New high-strength steels allow light and sustainable structures With the development of its HISTAR® range of steels for construction, ArcelorMittal has created structural steels which combine high yield strength with excellent toughness at low temperatures and outstanding weldability. Compared to conventional structural steels, HISTAR® beams exhibit significant weight and material cost savings.
A HISTAR® 460 beam weighs 32% less than a standard S355 JR grade beam of the same length and thickness. Material savings are around 30%. These new steels satisfy the demands of architects and designers for materials which enable them to create light and economical structures.
W EI G H T R E D U C TI O N B E N E FI T S Reduced CO2 emissions Reduced transport impact Job creation in R&D Reduced use of raw materials Reduced energy use High-strength steels have led to a 25 to 40% weight reduction over the past three decades, with corresponding decreases in emissions and energy use Construction Automotive Packaging Reduce in steel applications 9 For more examples of Reduce, go to the circular economy section of worldsteel.org CASE STUDY › Modern steelmakers use 60% less energy The efficient use and recovery of energy has enabled steelmakers to reduce the amount of energy required to produce a tonne of steel by around 60% since 1960. To help its members measure their energy performance against other steelmakers, worldsteel has introduced a comprehensive energy benchmarking system.
Members can compare a specific process in their plant against the top performers. Using this data, the steelmaker can identify where the energy performance of their process deviates from the reference and take action.
For every tonne of steel produced today, we save almost 24 GJ per tonne compared to 1960. That’s enough energy to drive an average passenger vehicle 17,380 km, which is equivalent to driving across the USA and back more than twice.

As well as extending the product’s life cycle, reuse avoids the need to transport and re-melt the steel, and to create new products. This has significant advantages for the environment and maximises the use of resources.
In a fully circular economy, the reuse of a manufactured product is considered in the earliest design phases of its creation. This allows both small- and large-scale products to be repurposed for another use quickly and efficiently once their initial use is fulfilled. High-speed rail tracks, for example, can be designed to wear to a certain point, at which they become suitable for reuse as low-speed tracks.
Buildings are a prime example of where designing for reuse is critical if we are to conserve resources. Modular design using steel construction methods and demountable connections (screws, bolts) allows buildings to be repurposed quickly and cost effectively without remanufacturing, as needs change. For example, a community might build a school to meet the needs of a growing population. As community needs change, the internal walls can be removed to create open spaces suitable for offices. Decades later the rooms can be re-divided to create retirement units.
Integrating reuse into the economy presents a range of new opportunities for consumers and steelmakers. In our current business model, buildings are typically constructed with new steel beams as their quality and strength is guaranteed by the steelmaker. In an economy where reuse is well established, steel companies will continue to examine new business models and may offer services such as testing and recertifying used beams before they are reused. This provides the builder with the safety guarantee they require, low-cost fast remodelling solutions for building owners, and a source of revenue for the steelmaker. Use of by-products Today, material efficiency is an integral part of the modern steelmaking process. Our goal is to use all raw materials to their full capacity, ensuring zero waste from steelmaking. This ambition guarantees that almost every by-product formed during steelmaking is used in new products. This approach minimises the amount of waste sent to landfill, reduces emissions, and preserves raw materials.
Slag is used to make a range of products including cement, fertilisers, and asphalt. Process gases from iron and steelmaking are typically used within the steelmaking plant, replacing steam and electricity, or exported to the local grid. Other by-products such as dust are used for their high metallic content.
Water is recirculated within the plant, especially for cooling purposes; around 90% of the water used in steelmaking is cleaned and either reused or returned to its source 5.
Reuse is using an object or material again, either for its original purpose or for a similar purpose, without significantly altering the physical form of the object or material.
USE AND REUSE 12 CASE STUDY › Reused steel gives old bridges an upgrade Faced with budget cuts, the engineers office in Muskingum County, Ohio (United States) decided to use salvaged beams to replace the superstructure of the local Green Valley Road Bridge.
The team removed old attachments from the beams before cutting them to the required lengths. A mock-up of the superstructure was created with the reused beams so that new cross-frames and stiffeners could be fitted. The entire structure was then disassembled, cleaned, and painted before being transported to the bridge site. This reuse of steel beams saved over US$50,000.

JFE Steel markets Marine Stone® - a crushed form of slag which is used in bodies of water with poor circulation. Typically oxygen levels at the bottom of the water body are low and hydrogen sulphide is produced, both of which can harm fish and shellfish which feed on sediment. The crushed slag attracts life to the area which helps to remediate the sediment.

Remanufacture involves the disassembly of a product, during which each component is thoroughly cleaned, examined for damage, and either reconditioned to original specifications or replaced with a new or upgraded part. The product is then reassembled and tested to ensure proper operation.
The goal is to create an application which can be offered with a guarantee that is equivalent or better than that of the original product. Remanufacturing differs from repairing, which is a process limited to making the product operational as opposed to thoroughly restoring it.
Many steel products such as construction and farm machinery, truck and car engines, electrical motors, domestic appliances, and wind turbines are already remanufactured. Remanufacturing takes advantage of the durability of steel components. It guarantees that the energy used to create the components is preserved – as only the faulty or worn components are replaced or reconditioned. Once recertified, the application is then ‘as-new’ and can continue to be utilised for longer.
Steel applications are particularly well suited to remanufacturing. The technology needed to work with steel is widespread, and the tools needed are relatively inexpensive and readily available.
The process of restoring durable, used steel products to as-new condition also helps to create jobs in communities. A key limitation to the success of remanufacturing is consumer behaviour. Consumers who are used to the ‘make, use and dispose’ linear economic model – common in developed economies – are the most reluctant to adopt remanufactured goods. But in emerging economies, remanufacturing is a normal concept which provides many families with access to labour-saving devices that might otherwise be out of their economic reach.
The steel industry encourages manufacturers to design their products with dismantling and remanufacturing in mind. Ensuring that components are modular, standard, and easy to remove means that they are more likely to be repaired or remanufactured.

Frequently remanufactured components include engines, drive trains, hydraulics, and the tracks which move vehicles such as bulldozers.
Customers return a used component to the OEM and receive a remanufactured product in return. This product has the same guarantee as the original and is immediately available to minimise machine downtime. Returning end-of-life components to as-new condition reduces waste and minimises the need for raw materials to produce new parts.
CASE STUDY › Breathing new life into wind turbines Wind power is one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy in the world. But demand for wind turbines is growing so rapidly that it can take up to two years for manufacturers to fulfil orders. By contrast, existing wind turbines can be remanufactured and delivered in as little as four months. Remanufactured turbines can keep wind farms at peak capacity, long beyond their designed lifetime. In fact, remanufacturing can almost double the return on the original investment by extending turbine life by up to 20 years. Around 80% of a typical wind turbine is made up of steel components. Various parts can be remanufactured to meet or exceed the original specifications including gearboxes, generators, bearings, and rotors.

All available steel scrap is recycled, over and over again to create new steel products in a closed material loop. Recycled steel maintains the inherent properties of the original steel. These properties can be modified during the steelmaking process or through mechanical processes to create the many thousands of advanced and commodity steel grades available. The quality of the steel product can also be improved on recycling.

Recycling is the action or process of converting waste into reusable material.

Recycling begins at the end - the ‘get rid’ stage of a product’s lifecycle. The circular economycircular economyA systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. It is based on three principles, driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature., however, goes right back to the beginning to prevent waste and pollution from being created in the first place. In the face of our current environmental challenges, recycling won’t be enough to overcome the sheer amount of waste we produce.

# Recycling and the Circular Economy

September 11, 2023  6 minute read

By Natalie Kra

The concept of “recycling” is one of the earliest examples of circular principles in practice. And while a more structured recycling system didn’t come into fruition in the US until the late 1900s, societies have been recycling and upcycling different materials for hundreds of years in the name of efficiency.

# Recycling and the Circular Economy

September 11, 2023  6 minute read

By [Natalie Kra](https://www.resonanceglobal.com/blog/author/natalie-kra)

The concept of “recycling” is one of the earliest examples of circular principles in practice. And while a more structured recycling system didn’t come into fruition in the US until the late 1900s, societies have been recycling and upcycling different materials for hundreds of years in the name of efficiency.

In the 1800s, [the “ragman” went from house to house to buy old cloth for international trade that turned rags into paper.](https://www.history.com/news/recycling-history-america) Later in the 19th century, more regimented trash collection systems emerged. Recycling and reusing of items were later kicked into high gear during WW2 because of deep rationing. The war resulted in the recycling of various materials such as cans, cooking oils and even the tin found in toothpaste tubes.

It was only in the 1960s that the practice of recycling began to intersect with the environmental movement, shedding light on the ways in which the recycling of different materials is an act of stewardship for the planet. [However, in the early days of environmentally-driven recycling](https://www.history.com/news/recycling-history-america), those who participated had to bring their recyclable waste to private recycling centers themselves. It was only once landfills began to reach their limit in the 1970s that recycling was turned to as a viable solution to the growing mounds of waste. It was at this point that curbside recycling services and more formalized infrastructure began to develop across the US.

Today, a robust, yet fragmented system exists across the globe with nuances by location and material. However, generally, the process usually consists of 3 main steps:

1. **collection**
2. **processing**
3. **remanufacturing**

During the collection phase, recyclable materials are generated by a consumer or business and then collected by a private hauler, government entity, or more informally by waste pickers. Once collected, often from the curbside in residential neighborhoods or from office buildings and business centers, the waste is taken to a processing facility where the materials are cleaned, sorted and prepared to be transported to a milling or manufacturing facility. Depending on the material, an extra processing step may be required in order to make the materials into mill-ready form. After the processing is completed, recyclable materials are made into new materials and products at recycling plants or paper mills to eventually be redistributed out onto the market.

## Challenges in Recycling

Although the process from collection through remanufacturing might seem straight forward, it really is anything but. For one, the materials that exist in today’s market have become increasingly complex and diverse, requiring more intricate and complicated processing technologies to create mill-ready products. Essentially, material innovation has outpaced the technological evolution of our recycling system and created pronounced challenges for waste management facilities.

This has resulted in a fragmented recycling system where some processors are able and willing to take in certain materials and others are not. This has created a disjointed system that varies across counties, cities, states, and countries – leaving constituents confused and municipalities overwhelmed.

Given the range of materials that exist today, and the varying processes required to manage them, the monetary value that can be recovered ranges, too – making the recycling of certain materials unappealing and uneconomical. Additionally, the value of certain materials fluctuates as a result of certain market dynamics.

This is especially true for plastics; the low value of certain plastic refuse combined with increasing costs of recycling and fluctuating petroleum prices means that recycling plastic often costs more than creating new products using virgin plastic. Considering that highly recyclable plastics like #1 and #2 will also eventually degrade over time (after roughly 2-3 cycles), the economics of recycling many kinds of plastics have become less compelling to processors.

In the US, a key solution to managing less-than-ideal plastics and other materials has been to export them abroad to other countries that are willing to offload and process these lower quality materials. Historically, much of the lower quality recycled materials generated in the United States have been exported internationally to China and other countries under this system. However, in recent years, changing international policies have limited the export of materials.

In 2018, for example, China stopped buying recyclables from overseas, which created ripple effects across the globe and disrupted the flow of recyclable materials. For context, before the ban [mainland China was the single largest importer of plastic waste, importing about 55.7% of world’s plastic waste (equivalent to 14,304,561 tons)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20741-9).    
   
That’s like 70 of the world’s largest cruise ships, or 5,700 Olympic swimming pools filled to the brim!

China’s decision to stop offloading this quantity of plastic has created challenges for numerous countries who do not have the systems in place to manage this level and type of waste. While the US has attempted to re-route much of this waste to other East Asian nations, the reality is that mounds of plastic refuse have begun to pile up at home, drowning local municipalities and governments under the weight of managing them.

It has become clear that our recycling system has not only been outpaced by material innovation but also by rapidly increasing production and consumption rates. I[n only 50 years, global use of materials has nearly quadrupled and in 2021, the mass of human-made things was found to outweigh all living beings and biomass](https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022#Download-the-report). The world is now producing twice as much plastic waste as two decades ago, with the bulk of it ending up in landfill, incinerated or leaking into the environment. Globally, only 9% of this plastic is recycled while 22% is mismanaged. Other resource intensive materials such as paper, textiles, electronics and chemicals face similar systemic challenges.

The rapid accumulation of waste from the excessive production, consumption, and disposal of these materials has resulted in profound impacts on both the built and natural environment. Leakage from overflowing landfills, intentional dumping of overflow refuse, and the incineration of waste with nowhere else to go continues to pollute cities and surrounding ecosystems.

In 2019, it was estimated that 6.1 million tons (Mt) of plastic waste leaked into aquatic environments, with 1.7 Mt flowing into oceans. The accumulation of waste in waterways is detrimental to marine life and the communities that live by, and rely on, these ecosystems.  Considering that plastic waste tends to be most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries whose livelihoods depend on thriving waters – the plastic problem is also an environmental justice issue, too.

## Circular Trends, Approaches, and Solutions

As the world continues to confront its waste problem, we will continue to witness accelerated innovation and investment in sustainable, just, and circular solutions that support the recycling revolution. These solutions should be aimed at increasing recovery, availability and usage of post-consumer recycled materials, moving the needle on recycling rates across the world.    
  
There are many different pathways that lead towards a more robust recycling system; however, many require the development of policy (such as extended producer responsibility schemes or post-consumer recycled material mandates) at both the local and national level, and increased access to capital to support the development of recycling infrastructure. As of 2023, six states in the US have active EPR laws and four states have passed laws requiring post-consumer recycled content in plastic packaging – with many more states following suit.    
Today, many companies, brands, NGOs, government agencies are banding together to create coalitions and initiatives aimed at collectively advancing recycling technologies, increasing the recovery of recyclable materials, and shaping the future of EPR.    
  
For example, [The U.S. Plastics Pact](https://usplasticspact.org/) brings together businesses, not-for-profit organizations, government agencies, and research institutions to work together toward a circular economy for plastics, as outlined by the [Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Initiative.](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/plastics/overview) Similarly, [The Plastic Pollution Coalition](https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/) is a global alliance that includes more than 1,300 organizations and 14,000 individuals who are united behind the goal of creating a more just, equitable, regenerative world free of plastic pollution. [The American Circular Textiles (ACT)](https://rtrshift.com/american-circular-textiles-policy-group/) policy group promotes mechanisms capable of improving textile reuse rates and mitigating waste such as EPR policy and the revision of the [FTC Green Guides](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/truth-advertising/green-guides).    
  
Together, these groups are advancing a more circular economy by pulling on various levers and involving a network of stakeholders. A systems level challenge like circularity requires buy-in and collaboration across the materials value chain – highlighting the necessity of industry wide partnerships such as these.   
  
In addition to collective advocacy efforts, companies are also making significant strides towards circularity by embracing sustainable materials and packaging within their own value chains.

### Corporate Commitments Related to Circularity of Plastics

The journey towards circularity often starts with commitment making and/or target-setting, creating a layer of accountability within the industry. For example, [Coca Cola has stated a goal of making 100% of their packaging recyclable globally by 2025](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/sustainability/packaging-sustainability) and to use at least 50% recycled material in their packaging by 2030. By 2024, [Adidas is aiming to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in all products where a solution exists](https://news.adidas.com/planet/new-personal-best--adidas-announces-96--of-polyester-used-in-its-products-is-now-recycled-polyester-/s/b0a60ae7-92db-4300-825a-f033217c021c#:~:text=96%25%20of%20all%20polyester%20used,be%20achieved%20earlier%20than%20expected.). And just this week, [PepsiCo's Chief Sustainability Officer Jim Andrew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpandrew/) provided featured insights in a [Forbes article on getting closer to global plastic circularity,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robkaplan/2023/09/07/a-discussion-with-jim-andrew-pepsicos-chief-sustainability-officer-getting-closer-to-global-plastic-circularity/?sh=2576643f2716) written by Rob Kaplan, Founder and CEO of Circulate Capital

These are just a few examples of cross-cutting commitments that demonstrate the sense of urgency shared by various industries to tackle the circularity challenge. Through these commitments, companies are helping to drive greater demand for recycled products – which can in turn help address the economic shortfalls of our recycling system.    
  
Although the increased recovery and recycling of plastics and other materials remains a key focus area for governments and organizations, we will also need to think beyond the Mobius strip to create a holistic waste management system that embodies circular principles and practices. Alternative areas of exploration include the development of novel materials such as bioplastics, compostables, and natural fibers, the scaling and normalization of reuse and repair systems, and consumer behavior change campaigns.

## Partnerships and Collaboration Key to Circularity Including Plastics

The circularity space is ripe for innovation that encourages both businesses and society to reimagine their relationships with waste. Many of the organizations and businesses engaged in partnerships we manage, as well as [companies participating in our Sustainable Impact Exchange roundtable series](/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVzb25hbmNlZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9ibG9nL2Jlc3QtcHJhY3RpY2VzLXRvLWxlYWQtYW5kLW1hbmFnZS1icmVha3BvaW50LWNoYW5nZS1pbi1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eQ%3D%3D&ct=SEARCH&pid=7126072&cid=81745401221&t=YnJlYWtwb2ludCBjaGFuZ2U%3D&d=www.resonanceglobal.com&c=2&c=3&c=6&rp=1&ab=false&opcid=&rs=UNKNOWN&hs-expires=1725996674&hs-version=1&hs-signature=APUk-v7mn5brs0EyU1FwB5hNkfST_3Q5Bw), view both the challenges and opportunities inherently critical to their long-term strategic sustainability goals and roadmaps, particularly in collaboration with other stakeholder companies [downstream in their supply chains](/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVzb25hbmNlZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9ibG9nL3RoZS1ncm93aW5nLXZvY2FidWxhcnktb2Ytc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQ%3D&ct=SEARCH&pid=7126072&cid=86067498896&t=dXBzdHJlYW0gZG93bnN0cmVhbQ%3D%3D&d=www.resonanceglobal.com&c=2&c=3&c=6&rp=1&ab=false&opcid=&rs=UNKNOWN&hs-expires=1725996603&hs-version=1&hs-signature=APUk-v6GWsnlTMoYfypx5Lk0xpgy5eA_LQ). We anticipate this will be an area that will require tremendous coordination and ingenuity to drive solutions and greater [sustainable impact](/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVzb25hbm

For those unfamiliar with the circular economy, it’s a closed-loop manufacturing system where materials or goods within the economy are kept inside it for as long as possible through reuse, remanufacturing, and refurbishment. Products are made to last through constant repairs and throw-away attitudes are discouraged.

Almost half of US e-waste is exported
-------------------------------------

[A Basel Action Network investigation](https://wiki.ban.org/images/1/12/ScamRecyclingReport-web.pdf) of two years determined that from 2014 to 2016, US e-waste recyclers exported about 40 percent of American e-waste. 93 percent of it was sent to developing countries. **Why is it an issue?**

*   Most developing nations cannot recycle these massive e-waste shipments as they have no basic infrastructure or e-waste management laws or e-waste recyclers to do so properly.
*   They employ at-risk communities, often children, to sort through the e-waste.
*   Final disposal is done through acid baths or incinerations that further harm the environment by polluting the air, soil, and water sources.
*   Workers (which often include children) suffer catastrophic health conditions due to unsafe e-waste recycling practices.
*   The transportation costs associated with e-waste exports only complicate the matter.

How is the 60% of e-waste processed at home?
--------------------------------------------

Does the 60 percent of waste we do not send abroad fare any better?

That depends on the e-waste recycling company you hire to deal with the issue. Remember that half of the US has no laws or legislation for proper e-waste recycling. Individuals still throw their discarded phones and tablets in the trash and businesses can get away with substandard or unsafe IT asset disposal at the enterprise level.

So, faced with the [complex e-waste crisis](https://hummingbirdinternational.net/blog/tools/ewaste-recycling-infographic/), environmentally responsible consumers find their own best solutions. One of those is local e-waste recyclers that comply with all the latest EPA guidelines and offer transparent e-waste recycling processes. The transparency ensures the e-waste they collect from you is recycled and disposed of as ethically as possible.

**Method****Availability****Environmental Impact****Key Concern**
Local EPA-Compliant Recyclers Limited Low Cost, convenience
Non-Compliant Disposal Common High Illegal dumping, pollution
Trash Bin / Landfill Frequent Very High Loss of valuable materials

Thanks to technological innovation and global reckoning, the hope for a waste-free future is alive and well. As people become more aware of the environmental impact of their throw-away consumerism and as more of them realize that tech manufacturers have created this culture to increase their profit margins, the tide has begun to turn.

E-waste recycling trends listed below are spearheading this mental and societal shift.

### 1. Advanced Sorting and Recycling Technologies

Can you use technology to answer issues created by technology?

Most definitely. In fact, that is the only path to follow.

![Image 3: Robotic arms sorting trash into recycling bins](https://hummingbirdinternational.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Recycling-Technologies.jpg)

As discussed in another article, [novel technologies](https://hummingbirdinternational.net/blog/e-waste-recycling/end-of-ewaste-problem/) can be the most fitting and lasting answer to the rampant e-waste crisis.

Innovating tech solutions like [artificial intelligence](https://rocketdigit.com/future-of-ai/) and robots can take over e-waste sorting from unskilled human labor and deliver more efficient results. Toxic e-waste fumes that harm human workers do not affect AI robots.

So equipping e-waste recycling facilities with these advanced robots can help reduce recycling costs, protect human workers from a physically toxic work environment, and perform the job [96% more accurately](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355959728_Application_of_artificial_intelligence_to_enhance_collection_of_E-waste_A_potential_solution_for_household_WEEE_collection_and_segregation_in_India).

### 2. Improved Material Recovery Techniques

Our [electronic devices are made with some of the rarest earth minerals](https://hummingbirdinternational.net/blog/e-waste-recycling/e-waste-materials-inside-devices/) and valuable materials. Gold, platinum, cobalt, tin, and other precious resources go into making every phone, TV, or iPad we use. Communities that mine these substances for global tech manufacturers often do so at grave risks to their health, safety, well-being, and human rights.

![Image 4: A large pile of colorful circuit boards and wires](https://hummingbirdinternational.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Material-Recovery-Techniques.jpg)

It’s ethically immoral to use these hard-earned minerals just once and then throw them in the bin.

Material recovery or [e-waste mining is an opportunity](https://hummingbirdinternational.net/blog/e-waste-recycling/e-waste-as-an-opportunity/) to correct this attitude. Through material recovery, valuable raw materials are reclaimed from discarded devices and used for further manufacturing.

To reduce the toxicity of this process, better material recovery techniques are on the horizon. Chemical methods like hydrometallurgical processes recover gold, silver, and platinum from discarded electronics in eco-friendly ways. Bioleaching is another method where bacteria and other microorganisms separate valuable raw materials from electronic waste.

**Material****Common Device Found In****Environmental Impact of Mining**
Gold Phones, Laptops High toxic chemicals are used
Cobalt Batteries Labor & health risks
Platinum Electronics circuits Water and soil contamination
Tin Solder, PCBs Deforestation, pollution

### 3. Circular Economy Integration

The [revenue from circular economy transactions](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1337519/circular-economy-market-revenue/) is estimated to reach 713 billion U.S. dollars by 2026. This projection is more than double the 2022 revenue of 339 billion U.S. dollars. The figure shows that more and more economic segments are keenly investing in circular economy programs.

For those unfamiliar with the [circular economy](https://hummingbirdinternational.net/blog/e-waste-recycling/e-waste-recycling-circular-economy/), it’s a closed-loop manufacturing system where materials or goods within the economy are kept inside it for as long as possible through reuse, remanufacturing, and refurbishment. Products are made to last through constant repairs and throw-away attitudes are discouraged.

### 4. Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Recycling

Innovative technologies like IoT, big data, cloud computing, and AI will be given center-stage in the future of e-waste recycling. Smart bins or e-bins are a revolutionary way to collect and manage e-waste. These bins, placed in public spaces, automate the process of e-waste sorting and recycling.

These bins can accurately assess recyclable parts and devices from non-recycl

Relevant Content: > From discarded televisions to dumped telephones, an enormous amount of ewaste is generated around the world. The latest research shows that the global challenge posed by e-waste is only going to grow. With less than half of the world implementing and enforcing approaches to manage the problem, this raises the alarm for sound regulations to boost collection and recycling. The Global E-waste Monitor is the world’s foremost source for e-waste data allowing us to track progress overtime and to make critical decisions when it comes to transitioning to a circular economy for electronics. Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava , Director, ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau [...] 20 March 2024, Geneva / Bonn - The world’s generation of electronic waste is rising five times faster than documented e-waste recycling, the UN’s fourth Global E-waste Monitor (GEM) reveals today.The 62 million tonnes of e-waste generated in 2022 would fill 1.55 million 40-tonne trucks, roughly enough trucks to form a bumper-tobumper line encircling the equator, according to the report from ITU and UNITAR. [...] The report foresees a drop in the documented collection and recycling rate from 22.3% in 2022 to 20% by 2030 due to the widening difference in recycling efforts relative to the staggering growth of e-waste generation worldwide.Challenges contributing to the widening gap include technological progress, higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, society’s growing electronification, design shortcomings, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure.

Introduction
------------

The need for exploratory research and analysis has always remained strong due to the imperative to enhance individuals' quality of life and ensure their safety, both now and in the future. The phenomenon of global warming and the resulting unpredictable weather patterns provide significant hazards to the well-being of the human population. One potential solution for addressing these concerns is the use of waste materials with little residue and a stringent “zero-defect” policy [1,2]. Emerging recycling technologies for the next generation are being explored as a potential solution to address the challenges posed by demanding materials, with the aim of promoting a sustainable and circular economy approach [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. These technologies possess the capacity to effectively repurpose waste materials while generating little or negligible emissions. This results in the establishment of a circular system whereby waste products are not just repurposed but also serve as inputs in the manufacturing process, hence reducing their environmental footprint [7,8]. Furthermore, these initiatives facilitate the implementation of a sustainable and economically viable strategy for resource management, resulting in reduced reliance on non-renewable energy sources and natural resources. By capitalizing on pre-existing waste streams, these technologies provide a viable and effective approach towards achieving environmental sustainability and fostering economic development. [[9], [10], [11], [12]].

When it comes to discarded electronics (e-waste), it has become one of the world's most rapidly expanding waste streams. Having so much electrical equipment that is getting close to the end of its useful life offers a significant challenge. Fig. 1 depicts the global e-waste generation and environmentally sound recycling rate. The United States of America (USA), China, India, Japan, and Brazil are among the top five countries producing electronic waste. By 2021, it was predicted that humans would have produced 57.4 million metric tons of e-waste, which is equivalent to around 63.3 million US metric tons [13]. The weight of all that waste would be enough to bring down the Great Wall of China, the greatest man-made monument in the world [14]. This staggering amount of electronic waste is difficult to manage, and its impact on the environment can be devastating. The hazardous components of electronic waste, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, can contaminate the soil and water resources nearby [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. In addition, the improper disposal of electronic waste can lead to air pollution through the release of noxious gases from burning components. To address this issue, it is important to look for ways to properly dispose of electronic waste and to create awareness about its potential effects. Electronic garbage comes from two main places: (a) large home equipment, including refrigerators, stoves, air conditioners, TVs, computer displays, laptop circuit boards, and so on; and (b) small electronic devices, mobile tech (cameras, cellphones, lighting, printers, etc.). Countless components go into making a single electronic circuit board, all of which work together to ensure that the equipment they are attached to has reliable bending strength, delamination time, peel strength, density, electrical performance for high-speed applications, thermal survivability, and overall performance throughout its useful life [19,20]. On average, printed circuit boards (PCB) comprise 30–35 wt% metals, 35–42 wt% refractories, and 24–30 wt% resins. The metallic proportions in PCB board are: 8–38% Fe, 10–27% Cu, 2–19% Al, 1–3% Pb, 0.3–2% Ni, 200–3000 ppm Ag, 20–1200 ppm Au, and 10–300 ppm Pd. Polymers such as polycarbonate (PC), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and refractory materials such as silica and alkaline oxides in organic forms are used. Additionally, polyimide and epoxy laminates are also used to provide the mechanical integrity and thermal stability of the PCB [[21], [22], [23]]. Therefore, the health and sustainability of human populations are at risk due to the current low recycling rates for electronic waste. The proper handling of e-waste is crucial for environmental safety and prevention of any negative effects. The recycling of e-waste has serious challenges when it comes to finding humane and environmentally sound ways to treat materials of this kind. It is a time-consuming and expensive technique to recover certain elements from e-waste. The proper management of e-waste is, therefore, essential and involves recycling and reusing of parts in such a way as to avoid contamination of the environment or human health [2,24,25].

In an era plagued by incessant technical advancements, electronic gadgets have become an indispensable component of contemporary existence. Nevertheless, the exponential expansion of electronic devices has unintentionally resulted in the emergence of a substantial predicament. The current dilemma poses a dual quandary for society.
*   1.**The E-Waste Predicament**: The rapid advancement of technology has resulted in a significant collection of abandoned electronic devices due to their increasing obsolescence. The improper management of electronic waste, which is comprised of a diverse combination of elements, presents a significant environmental and health risk. It is of utmost importance to handle this rapidly growing situation [26,27]. 
*   2.**Industry 4.0 Imperative**: Simultaneously, the emergence of Industry 4.0 heralds a new epoch in the realm of manufacturing and production. Smart factories and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have the potential to significantly transform industrial processes, leading to improved efficiency and enhanced competitiveness. Nonetheless, the incorporation of electronic waste recycling within this framework poses a complex obstacle, necessitating the development of inventive resolutions [[28], [29], [30], [31]]. 

The accelerated growth of mechatronic and CPS in multiple sectors has fundamentally altered automation, promoting improved precision, versatility, and interconnectivity in manufacturing and other areas. Nonetheless, this integration concurrently engenders an escalating volume of intricate e-waste characterized by distinctive attributes that conventional recycling methodologies are inadequate to address efficiently. Devices comprising mechatronic and CPS architectures frequently encompass elaborate assemblies of sensors, actuators, embedded systems, and specialized materials, thereby complicating the processes of disassembly and material recovery [32,33]. In addition, the interrelation of hardware and software within these systems exacerbates the recycling challenges due to potential data security concerns and the intricacy involved in segregating valuable components from deleterious substances. The existing methodologies for the management of electronic waste exhibit deficiencies in the requisite technological sophistication imperative for the proficient recovery of resources from present-day electronic devices. This inadequacy culminates in material wastage, augmented environmental pollution, and the forfeiture of opportunities for circular economy initiatives. There exists an imperative for innovative methodologies in e-waste management that take into account the complex architectures and high-value components characteristic of CPS and mechatronic systems. Such methodologies must prioritize efficient disassembly, automated sorting, and advanced material recovery techniques, with a focus on minimizing hazardous waste while maximizing resource reutilization.

This review aspires to systematically analyze the prevailing deficiencies in e-waste recycling in relation to CPS and mechatronic integration. It will investigate cutting-edge e-waste recycling technologies, regulatory frameworks, and exemplary practices in sustainable material recovery, proposing strategies to bolster a circular economy pertinent to these advanced systems. Furthermore, it will explore the function of intelligent recycling facilities that utilize CPS themselves for effective e-waste management, thereby establishing a closed-loop process for the lifecycle management of mechatronic and CPS systems. Through the provision of a comprehensive synthesis and the identification of domains necessitating further inquiry, this review endeavors to establish a foundation for mitigating the environmental repercussions of CPS and mechatronic e-waste, promoting sustainable innovation and aligning with forward-looking, resource-efficient manufacturing paradigms.

Relevant Content: ### 2. Products-as-a-service (PAAS) model for electronics

Another effective circular business strategy is the PAAS model. In this scenario, a customer pays a fee to use an electronic product but does not own it. For example, an IT company may utilize a PAAS model for its computer hardware products and offer a monthly subscription fee for users, which encourages the company to refurbish and remanufacture its products at the point of return.

Due to the PAAS “fee-based” model, a producer is incentivized to manufacture products that incorporate product life extension (PLE) designs, modularity and proper treatment at the end of life. [...] To support recyclable material sourcing processes, digital tools (e.g., digital passports and blockchain) can help companies source key materials from secondary markets and forecast supply and demand dynamics (CEP 2022). Leveraging secondary markets is an effective strategy for companies to source scrap metals from other industries, such as aerospace or advanced manufacturing, to create, for example, carbon-fiber-reinforced polycarbonate bases that could be used for assembling new laptops (Murphy 2021). Utilizing recyclable and modular designs in a shared model can optimize product retrieval efficiencies and increase their life-spans.

### 2. Products-as-a-service (PAAS) model for electronics [...] Finally, a company may default to the traditional product ownership model to give customers full control over the product lifecycle. Unlike in the shared economy and PAAS models, a manufacturer in this model loses the incentive to manufacture products that promote PLE and DFR principles — a key tenet of the circular economy.

#### By integrating circularity into their electronics design and recovery strategies, businesses can realize environmental and economic benefits.

---

**In brief**

* Only 17.4% of electronic waste is recycled globally, leading to heightened environmental and health issues, particularly in economically developing countries.
* Electronic waste is leading to a loss of at least US$57 billion annually through the disposal of key raw materials, such as iron, copper, gold and others.
* Adopting circular models can help companies access untapped opportunities and lower environmental impact to address critical e-waste challenges.

---

Waste from electronics, such as cell phones, computers and other digital devices, represents the world’s fastest-growing waste stream, increasing at an alarming pace of 2Mt per year¹: equivalent to roughly 9,000¹ **Statues of Liberty.** In 2019 alone, approximately 53Mt of e-waste (excluding photovoltaic panels) were generated, with 2030 projections estimated to exceed 74Mt.  In addition, 80% to 85% of e-waste is not formally collected or properly managed.

E-waste is often shipped to developing countries, leaking into the informal sector and thereby intensifying human rights issues globally. This waste is particularly dangerous because it contains several toxic additives and hazardous substances, including mercury, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). These materials, if not properly controlled, can expose locals to high levels of contaminants (e.g., lead and cadmium), airborne pollutants and contaminated groundwater, which can cause significant human healthrisks, such as cancers, neurological damage and diminished IQs.

## Other challenges beyond human and health risks associated with e-waste include:

1. Lack of recycling infrastructure: Existing waste management technologies, rapid urbanization, and limited institutional and human resource capacities limit the ability to properly scale recycling capabilities. India, for example, generates more than 3Mt of electronic waste annually but recycles less than 3% (Kretchmer 2021).
2. High costs and recycling difficulties: Recovery of materials, such as germanium and indium, is challenging because they are disbursed across multiple components in one device that cannot be easily disassembled. Lithium batteries pose additional challenges, as the recycling infrastructure cannot easily adapt to the rapid technological changes and differing device sizes (Yanamandra, Pinisetty and Daoud 2022).
3. Low recycling rates: Only 17.4% of global e-waste is recycled (Kuehr, et al. 2022). These rates are further exacerbated by poor disposal habits of treating e-waste as household waste, which may encourage the illegal transboundary movement of e-waste (Kuehr, et al. 2022).
4. Enforcing regulations: A lack of enforced standards for collection, dismantling and treatment hinder the environmentally sound management of e-waste.

Electronic devices house a wide variety of valuable materials, such as iron, copper and gold, which are worth a combined US$57 billion (Kuehr, et al. 2022). Only US$10 billion is recovered in an environmentally sound manner while the rest piles up, at great societal risk, in landfills or in the open environment (Forti 2020). Adopting circular business models presents a unique opportunity for businesses to create value, lower environmental and human health impact, and generate profitability.

## Implementing circular economy business models

Current economic systems assume a constant supply of natural resources, resulting in a “take-make-use-dispose” linear model (Centre 2015). Circular business models, on the other hand, focus on redesigning product-service systems to enhance business capabilities and market competitiveness. A shift toward circular economy models can help companies not only access untapped financial and business opportunities but also lower their overall environmental impact. For example, a company can recover over 100 times more gold from one ton of mobile phones than traditionally mining one ton of gold ore (Ryder and Houlin 2019). To help realize the value from a circular economy model, and address critical e-waste challenges, companies can leverage three alternative business models:

### 1. Shared economy model for electronics

A shared economy model helps generate revenue through provisioning services instead of selling products. This model shifts conventional producer-consumer relationships and re-evaluates traditional value chains. For instance, companies can lease electronics to consumers; once the device reaches its maximum life-span, the producer recycles, maintains and refurbishes the device. Additionally, by investing in durable and modular design strategies, companies can enhance product value by simplifying disassembly and recyclability of materials and capitalize from the recovery of precious metals (Atasu, Dumas and Van Wassenh 2021).

To support recyclable material sourcing processes, digital tools (e.g., digital passports and blockchain) can help companies source key materials from secondary markets and forecast supply and demand dynamics (CEP 2022). Leveraging secondary markets is an effective strategy for companies to source scrap metals from other industries, such as aerospace or advanced manufacturing, to create, for example, carbon-fiber-reinforced polycarbonate bases that could be used for assembling new laptops (Murphy 2021). Utilizing recyclable and modular designs in a shared model can optimize product retrieval efficiencies and increase their life-spans.

### 2. Products-as-a-service (PAAS) model for electronics

Another effective circular business strategy is the PAAS model. In this scenario, a customer pays a fee to use an electronic product but does not own it. For example, an IT company may utilize a PAAS model for its computer hardware products and offer a monthly subscription fee for users, which encourages the company to refurbish and remanufacture its products at the point of return.

Due to the PAAS “fee-based” model, a producer is incentivized to manufacture products that incorporate product life extension (PLE) designs, modularity and proper treatment at the end of life.

Designing for PLE can fall short if there is not a cost-effective and globally functioning reverse logistics system that guarantees the proper recovery and disassembly of products (CEP 2022). Due to the hazardous components of e-waste, recyclers can leverage technologies and artificial intelligence to properly sort and identify the material composition of products and deploy robotics to disassemble materials while reducing health risks and contamination. An IT asset disposition (ITAD) and electronic equipment recycling company, for example, could adapt to the semiconductor shortage by utilizing technology to properly extract chips from e-waste and expand precious metal usage (CEP 2022).

### 3. Product ownership model — utilizing PLE and design for recyclability (DFR) principles

Finally, a company may default to the traditional product ownership model to give customers full control over the product lifecycle. Unlike in the shared economy and PAAS models, a manufacturer in this model loses the incentive to manufacture products that promote PLE and DFR principles — a key tenet of the circular economy.

In the product ownership model, a company could identify stages in the product lifecycle where improvements can be made to extend the use of the product. Here, companies can emphasize the recyclability and modularity of a product, as well as create incentives for consumers to return their products for refurbishments or resale. A cellular device company could develop a buy, repair and trade-in program to promote proper recycling practices and expand secondary markets for recovered metals.

## Moving ahead

E-waste circular business models offer a unique opportunity for companies to create value in terms of increased profitability and lower environmental impact. Companies should consider the following as they develop a holistic circular model for their businesses:

1. The initial success of a circular economy business model is designing one that aligns with the company’s current resource capabilities. A shared economy model may initially only work for companies with modular-designed products, such as commercial photocopiers where an ink cartridge replacement may be more economically feasible than retrieving an intricately constructed washing machine company’s assets (Atasu, Dumas and Van Wassenh 2021). A company may choose a host of levers from the circular business models, such as PAAS subscription services, modular design of a product‘s functional components and sourcing durable materials to develop a meaningful strategy.
2. Cross-industry and stakeholder partnerships are also critical in implementing a sophisticated circular strategy to address e-waste globally. In 2021, the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP) was created to coordinate efforts toward achieving circularity business models. The CEP aims to drive cross-industry collaboration to scale circularity initiatives, such as the development of secondary markets; circular incentives for consumers, such as take-back programs; and achieving cost-effective reverse logistics (CEP 2022). Partnerships such as the CEP are vital to support and scale new strategies with closed loop models in mind.
3. Additionally, the circular strategy should focus not only on the engineering and product design levels but also on syncing a company’s full value chain, from the design and business model stages, to providing access, education and infrastructure for consumers at scale. Exclusively designing circular products that still end up in a landfill isn’t better than linear products (as it hasn’t closed the loop).

By leveraging strategic circular economy business models to address the tsunami of e-waste, companies can capitalize from financial opportunities, strengthen value chain relationships, and create long-lasting organizational value.

## 1 Introduction

The Circular Economy (CE) concept signifies a transformative approach to resource management and economic development, especially within the manufacturing industry [[1](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR1 ""Chizaryfard A, Trucco P, Nuur C.

                ."")]. The linear model, characterized by resource extraction, product manufacturing, and waste disposal, has led to considerable resource depletion and environmental degradation. CE, however, motivates a regenerative model that aims to separate economic expansion from resource utilization [[3](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR3 ""Geissdoerfer M. The circular economy - A new sustainability paradigm? J Clean Prod. 2017;143:757–68."")]. In a traditional linear economy, the ‘take-make-dispose’ model predominates, where raw materials are extracted, transformed into products, and eventually discarded as waste after use [[3](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR3 ""Geissdoerfer M. The circular economy - A new sustainability paradigm? J Clean Prod. 2017;143:757–68.""), [4](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR4 ""Ejaz MR, Hegedűs D. Designing a conceptual framework for industry 4.0 technologies to enable circular economy ecosystem. Manag Glob Transit. 2023;21(2):121–48."")]. This process is resource intensive, often leads to overconsumption, and results in significant environmental degradation due to waste accumulation and depletion of natural resources. In contrast, the CE framework emphasizes a ‘reduce-reuse-recycle’ approach, aiming to minimize resource use and waste generation throughout a product’s lifecycle [[5](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR5 ""Zorpas AA.

                ."")]. This model creates a closed-loop system where economic activities are separated from resource extraction and thus by promoting the sustainability, and mitigating the environmental impacts associated with traditional production methods. Closed-loop systems keep products and materials in use as long as possible, ensuring maximum value extraction before resource recovery and regeneration, thereby minimizing waste and emissions. This approach also strengthens adaptability to resource constraints and regulatory requirements [[7](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR7 ""Ghisellini P, Cialani C, Ulgiati S.

J Clean Prod. 2020;274: 122964."")]. The adoption of CE principles is of great importance in the manufacturing sector, where there are higher levels of resource extraction, production, and waste disposal [[10](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR10 ""Reike D, Vermeulen WJV, Witjes S.

This contribution is frequently associated with significant environmental consequences. The sector’s dependence on resource intensive methods, energy utilization, and waste production underscores its dual function as an economic driver and a significant factor in environmental deterioration. This contrast highlights the pressing necessity for the implementation of CE concepts, which provide a means to lessen these environmental effects while preserving industrial productivity and economic competitiveness. By adopting CE, manufacturing sectors can reduce their environmental footprint while promoting economic value and innovation [[7](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#ref-CR7 ""Ghisellini P, Cialani C, Ulgiati S.

### 1.1 Methodology

This review aims to offer a thorough examination of the incorporation of CE ideas in the manufacturing sectors. It specifically focuses on the difficulties, advancements, and routes to achieving sustainable transformation. To accomplish this, a methodical investigation of existing literature was carried out. The methodology employed is intended to guarantee a meticulous and comprehensive investigation of appropriate literature, driven by precise inclusion criteria and search methodologies.

A comprehensive and methodical search and selection process was carried out in July 2024 to locate relevant material on the application of CE principles in manufacturing. The procedure started with a preliminary search that made use of the Scopus database and strategically chosen keywords to increase relevancy. The search query consisted of the following keywords such as ‘Circular Economy in Manufacturing’, ‘Circular Principles in Manufacturing’, and ‘Circularity in Manufacturing’. These keywords were chosen to encompass a wide range of studies relating to the implementation of CE concepts in the manufacturing industry. The scope of this search was limited to publications released between January 2019 and June 2024 to guarantee the incorporation of the most current and relevant studies and a few notable publications in the past also referred. Figure [1](/article/10.1007/s43621-024-00689-2#Fig1) depicts the year-wise collection of the articles in the above-mentioned keywords. The search results were subjected to specific filters that limited the inclusion of journal publications to those designated as ‘articles’ or ‘reviews’ and authored in English. This improved the overall quality and consistency of the results.

After the first search, a stringent screening procedure was performed. The publications that were retrieved were carefully reviewed for relevance to the review topic based on the titles and abstracts. Articles that failed to meet the inclusion requirements were not considered. To preserve the dataset’s integrity, any duplicates found during this stage were also eliminated.

The next step was a thorough full-text analysis of the remaining publications. Making sure that every chosen item satisfies all set inclusion criteria required this step. The papers were assessed based on their capacity to offer adequate information about the incorporation of CE concepts in manufacturing settings. Articles that did not have this essential depth were not included in the final analysis.

The elimination of these duplicate articles was executed via Zotero, a reference management program that enabled the effective identification and removal of duplicates from the search results. To guarantee the quality of the chosen papers, multiple criteria were utilized during the evaluation process. The studies were evaluated for their methodological rigor, encompassing the suitability of research design and data analysis techniques, the journals in which the studies appeared were examined for their impact factors, prioritizing those with higher impact as a quality indicator; and only peer-reviewed articles were incorporated into the final selection, ensuring that the research had been subjected to thorough scrutiny by field experts.

#### 1.1.1 Publication Bias

To alleviate the risk of publication bias, the review implemented various procedures throughout the literature search and selection process. A thorough search approach was implemented across many databases, including Scopus, to encompass a broad spectrum of investigations, comprising articles, case studies and reviews. This method sought to incorporate several viewpoints and findings pertaining to CE practices. Additionally, during the selection process, this review intentionally included research with diverse outcomes, whether confirmatory, adverse, or ambiguous, to furnish a comprehensive overview of the literature. The review additionally examines studies from various geographical places and manufacturing industries to supplement the diversity of viewpoints. Through the implementation of these methodologies, this review sought to mitigate the effects of publication bias and deliver a more rigorous and dependable synthesis of the current research on CE in manufacturing.

Technological advancement allows manufacturers to reuse items and may provide more efficient material recovery. Currently, most repair activities are performed manually, but digital transformation can ease some tasks by integrating the complete ecosystem of electronic devices. The essential procedure is to develop a value chain to easily search and exchange products and components for new repairs and remanufacturing  (p. 60). Structural differences within the EEE industry—such as supply chain complexity, product lifecycles, competition, and regulation—play a crucial role in shaping circular economy (CE) uptake. [...] local repair economies. The CE also drives innovation and infrastructure development (SDG 9) and fosters inclusive economic growth (SDG 8) by creating green jobs in repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. Reducing raw material extraction supports SDG 15 (Life on Land) and helps limit waterway pollution (SDG 14). Circular approaches in manufacturing also minimise water use and contamination, advancing SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Furthermore, circular models like product leasing and sharing platforms can improve access to affordable goods, supporting SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

Abstract
--------

The circular economy (CE) encourages sustainability by shifting towards business models that prolong resource use. The quantity of waste generated by electric and electronic equipment (WEEE or e-waste) is rapidly rising and is one of the fastest-growing waste streams. Our paper explores the awareness, benefits, barriers, incentives, and implementation of CE in the electric and electronic equipment (EEE) industry in Slovenia and Croatia. In the theoretical section, we review the existing literature on CE, the EEE industry in both countries, and their policy frameworks for developing CE. Based on primary research through a survey and inferential statistical analysis in the empirical section, we investigate the implementation of CE in the EEE industry in both countries. This paper identifies which CE practices companies in the EEE industry implement, how company size affects CE implementation, how companies evaluate institutional support to CE, and their plans regarding CE. The results highlight some differences between the two countries. Drawing on the empirical findings, we determine key challenges and opportunities for increasing CE adoption in this sector and formulate some European suggestions for policymakers, industry practitioners, and researchers.

1. Introduction
---------------

Circular economy (CE) helps to protect the environment and promotes economic resilience and innovation, while encouraging more responsible production and consumption patterns. It is an economic system based on the principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems [1]. It focuses on immediate financial benefits from decreased resource usage, better efficiency, and less waste. CE supports sustainability, which seeks long-term benefits for the entire economic, environmental, and social systems [2] (p. 83). CE can separate economic growth from resource use and consumption, making it a tool for achieving sustainable development [3] (pp. 3–4). It has been proven to positively impact the profitability and feasibility of manufacturing enterprises by creating additional value through the recovery of materials and assets that produce new income streams. It aids company growth by introducing new business ideas. It is critical for resource optimisation in the manufacturing sector, which includes methods like remanufacturing, recycling, and closed-loop production processes, reducing reliance on virgin resources and waste formation. Extended producer responsibility as a CE practice encourages manufacturers to be responsible for their products throughout their lives, including correct disposal, recycling, or reuse at the end of life. This helps them reduce landfill waste and build circular supply chains [4] (p. 3).

The circular economy (CE), which emphasises designing out waste, keeping materials in use, and regenerating natural systems, aligns closely with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [5]. The CE can accelerate progress across multiple SDGs by shifting from the traditional linear “take-make-dispose” model to a regenerative system. CE supports SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting resource efficiency, waste reduction, and sustainable product design. It also contributes to SDG 13 (Climate Action) through reduced emissions from recycling and lower energy consumption. In urban contexts, circular practices enhance SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) via improved waste management and local repair economies. The CE also drives innovation and infrastructure development (SDG 9) and fosters inclusive economic growth (SDG 8) by creating green jobs in repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. Reducing raw material extraction supports SDG 15 (Life on Land) and helps limit waterway pollution (SDG 14). Circular approaches in manufacturing also minimise water use and contamination, advancing SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Furthermore, circular models like product leasing and sharing platforms can improve access to affordable goods, supporting SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

While academic research has laid the foundation for the circular economy, e.g., [6], global consulting firms are increasingly developing business models around measuring circularity. A key example is the Circularity Gap Reporting Initiative by Circle Economy and Deloitte, which has popularised the term “circularity gap” [7]. Although influential, the concept can be misleading by implying that the gap can be fully closed, overlooking constraints like entropy and material degradation [8,9]. Calls for “fully circular” economies often ignore these limitations. Scholars such as Cullen [10] and Figge et al. [11] argue that perfectly balanced closed-loop systems are unrealistic. A more practical approach involves gradually improving circularity through targeted policies and business strategies [12], building on existing practices thriving in specific sectors.

The volume of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE or e-waste) increased from 7.6 million tonnes in 2012 to 13.5 million tonnes in 2021 (+77.1%) in the European Union (EU). The overall quantity of WEEE collected rose from 3 million tonnes in 2012 to 4.9 million tonnes in 2021 (+65.1%). A considerable volume of WEEE is created and ends up in landfills without treatment. However, recovered WEEE increased from 2.6 to 4.4 million tonnes (+69.8%), whereas garbage recycled and processed for reuse rose from 2.4 million to 4 million tonnes (+64.8%) between 2012 and 2021 [13,14], which proves that CE implementation is increasing in this industry [15]. Globally, only a small percentage of total WEEE is properly collected and recycled. There is still a substantial difficulty in realising the potential environmental, social, and economic benefits of CE implementation within the electric and electronic equipment (EEE) industry. This highlights the critical need for appropriate support to CE practices to minimise environmental impact and maximise WEEE’s economic worth. Its proper management through CE practices can help prevent environmental pollution and reduce health concerns related to dangerous compounds, while recovering valuable materials that contribute to economic sustainability. The low percentage of correct WEEE recycling and the prevalence of improper disposal underline the need for enhanced CE techniques to capture these advantages better [16] (pp. 2–3).

The implementation of CE practices in the EEE industry brings a range of significant economic, environmental, and social benefits. Economically, adopting circular practices can reduce operational costs, increase sales and profitability, lower business","## Circular Economy and End-of-Life Management

**Circular economy practices, such as remanufacturing and product-as-a-service (PaaS) models, are critical to reducing e-waste and extending product lifecycles.** These approaches not only minimize environmental impact but also create economic opportunities by recovering value from discarded products.

### Key Circular Economy Practices

1. **Remanufacturing**: This process restores used products to ""as-new"" condition, conserving resources and reducing energy consumption. For example, remanufacturing wind turbines can extend their lifespan by up to 20 years, saving 80% of energy compared to producing new units. Similarly, industrial machinery manufacturers design components like engines and hydraulics for remanufacturing, reducing waste and raw material usage (Canadian Steel, 2024).

2. **Product-as-a-Service (PaaS)**: PaaS models shift the focus from ownership to access, incentivizing manufacturers to design durable, repairable products. For instance, Philips' Circular Lighting service maintains and upgrades lighting systems rather than replacing them, reducing material use. GE Healthcare’s PaaS model for medical imaging equipment has extended the life of 6,700 units, preventing 5.15 million kilograms of landfill waste (BNP Paribas, 2025).

3. **Recycling and Modular Design**: Modular designs simplify disassembly and recycling, enabling efficient material recovery. For example, Schneider Electric integrates IoT and smart waste management into its circular initiatives, diverting thousands of tons of waste from landfills. Modular designs in electronics can reduce e-waste by up to 50%, as demonstrated by the Circular Electronics Partnership (Altium, 2024).

### Benefits and Challenges

Circular economy practices offer measurable benefits:
- **Cost Savings**: Remanufacturing and PaaS models can reduce costs by 12% on average across industries, with up to 36% savings in ICT sectors (PwC, 2023).
- **Environmental Impact**: Circular strategies can lower CO2 emissions by 10-15%, with significant reductions in resource extraction and waste generation (PwC, 2023).
- **Economic Growth**: Circular models create green jobs in repair, remanufacturing, and recycling, supporting inclusive economic growth (MDPI, 2025).

However, challenges remain:
- **Technological Barriers**: Advanced recycling technologies, such as robotic sorting and bioleaching, are essential but require significant investment (ScienceDirect, 2024).
- **Regulatory Gaps**: Inconsistent global regulations hinder the scalability of circular practices, particularly in e-waste management (UNITAR, 2024).

### Case Study: Netherlands Ventilation-as-a-Service Pilot

Zehnder Group’s pilot in the Netherlands explores ventilation-as-a-service and refurbishment business models. By retaining ownership of ventilation units, the company ensures efficient reuse and refurbishment. Early results show potential for scaling these models across Europe, with a target to generate significant revenue from refurbished products by 2030 (Zehnder Group, 2024).

Source Title: Sustainability regulation outlook 2024 - Deloitte
URL: https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/environmental-social-governance/sustainability-regulation-outlook.html
Relevant Content: The regulation will have a wide reach, particularly in the consumer industry, affecting companies that sell into or export from the EU market products made or fed with certain commodities, such as cattle, soya, rubber, wood, coffee, palm oil or cocoa. In 2024 the EC may extend the scope of the regulation by adding more commodities to the list. Further down the line CSDDD will introduce rules requiring EU and non-EU companies to conduct environmental and human rights due diligence across their operations, subsidiaries and value chains. Companies will have to take measures to prevent or mitigate any potential impacts they identify, as well as end or minimise any real impacts. If companies fail to comply and damage occurs as a result they may be held liable and face financial penalties. [...] In 2024 the EU will finalise the Directive for Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition. The European Commission proposed the Directive in March 2022 to introduce specific rules to tackle unfair commercial practices that mislead consumers and may prevent them from consuming sustainably. The Directive amends the EU’s Consumer Rights Directive and Unfair Commercial Practice Directive. By defining which B2C communications should be banned or considered misleading, the Directive will provide greater clarity on how companies can market their environmental performance. Once the rules enter into force in the first half of the year the EU will become a global leader in regulating companies’ environmental claims. Every industry will be directly affected by the Directive unless it has existing [...] ### Heightened litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny

Companies should not only consider new regulations when assessing the regulatory environment around greenwashing. Action by advertising or competition authorities, or litigation by investors and civil society, may also generate greenwashing risk, possibly sooner than new regulations. Consumer-facing industries, especially those selling and advertising more frequently purchased and essential items, are more likely to experience these impacts.22 Advertisers and organisations marketing products, services and brands online will also be particularly affected.

Time is running out to act on climate change. In Europe, the transition to a lower carbon and more sustainable society is reshaping the economy, creating new opportunities, and altering the cost of doing business. For companies, the implications are stark. Failing to become more sustainable will leave them vulnerable to the loss of revenue and reputation, as well as to litigation and regulatory penalties.

Regulation is an important driver of these changes, and a critical consideration for companies as they plan how to meet the commitments they have made to transition their own businesses. 2024 will be a pivotal year for the roll out of sustainability-related regulations. Several key sustainability initiatives will be finalised and EU Parliament elections in June will determine the direction and level of ambition of the next wave of the EU’s sustainability legislative activity. Our *Sustainability Regulation Outlook*explores the most pressing developments in the year ahead and what these mean for business strategies and operating models.

The EU’s response to the imperative on climate begins with enhanced **sustainability reporting** and the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). For most companies, work remains to be done to meet new reporting requirements in full. What is more, sustainability reporting sits at the heart of the EU’s green strategy and the information companies need to disclose draws on data and activities across the organisation. CSRD can be exploited to generate change and efficiencies across other regulatory-driven developments.

Beyond reporting requirements, our outlook highlights four themes for companies to focus on this year.

#### Table of contents

* [Sustainability reporting enters a decisive phase](#sustainabilty-reporting)
* [Making circularity and circular design the norm](#making-circularity)
* [Making supply chains sustainable and resilient](#making-supply)
* [Decarbonisation gaps and focus areas](#decarbonisation-gaps)
* [Averting greenwashing risks](#averting-greenwashing)

**Circularity** is now a clear imperative. In 2024, companies should focus on understanding what circular design means for their products and services, with EU regulatory initiatives establishing requirements for product design, packaging and packaging waste, the ability to repair products, and provisions on end-of-life waste disposal, among other things. The focus on circular design can also create opportunity for companies. For example, in sourcing secondary materials, designing products using other companies’ waste, and providing repair services.   

The EU is a frontrunner globally in shaping **supply chain** sustainability as part of its strategy to decarbonise the economy. CSRD obliges companies to report not only on their own operations but also their upstream and downstream supply chains. This means companies must invest more resources in relationships with their suppliers and integrate sustainability-related risk assessment into their purchasing decisions. Use of rare earth metals, contributions to deforestation and relationships with companies within countries with human rights abuses are amongst the factors companies need to assess. The deforestation-free regulation, for example, prohibits the sale, import or export of certain commodities unless it can be proven they are deforestation-free and produced in compliance with the relevant legislation of the producer country.

**Decarbonisation** is the ultimate goal of many of the EU initiatives. CSRD will affect most industries, obliging companies to track emissions and report their reduction targets. The carbon border adjustment mechanism is one of many other relevant EU regulatory initiatives. It makes it necessary to report emissions data on imported carbon-intensive products such as aluminium, steel and cement, which will be taxed on their carbon content from 2026. Buildings and real estate also present major challenges. From 2024 the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive will seek to ensure that buildings across the EU meet minimum energy performance standards. To reach net zero, companies should look to invest in projects or take action to avoid and reduce or remove from the atmosphere and store greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Finally, to minimise their exposure to **greenwashing** risk, companies must ensure there is no mismatch between what they say they are doing and what they are doing. The EU Directive for Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition means that corporate communications must change to avoid greenwashing. As from 2026, generic phrases such as ‘green,’ ‘carbon neutral’, ‘biodegradable’ and ‘eco-friendly’ will no longer be permitted. Companies will have to ensure that their environmental messaging is clear and fully substantiated.

Companies need a plan of action that connects the moving parts on sustainability across regulation and business strategy, and identifies opportunities for increasing collaboration between finance, internal risk management and procurement departments. Within this plan, companies can factor in what leading practice looks like, the most effective way to manage and sequence the changes required and what further changes to requirements are expected.

## Sustainability reporting enters a decisive phase

Sustainability reporting sits at the heart of the EU’s green strategy. Over the next few years, the journey towards greater transparency of companies’ sustainability credentials through disclosures will accelerate. The focus for companies in 2024 is to address corporate sustainability reporting requirements. Significant effort and resources will need to be dedicated to meet these requirements. The real opportunity for companies from reporting requirements, however – and the longer-term effectiveness of their approach – will come from looking beyond the compliance task to consider the broader ramifications of the regulations across their entire business and operating models. If positioned correctly, these projects can help drive a wider set of changes to harmonise understanding of and embed a firm’s sustainability strategy across the organisation. **The European and international reporting landscape is changing**.

Now is the time that ambition for greater transparency needs to be put into practice.In 2024, all eyes are on the CSRD and corresponding European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Even though the European Commission has reduced the scope of the reporting burden in the short term, around 50,000 companies are expected to publish data under CSRD – more than four times the number that reported sustainability information under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) that CSRD is replacing. For the largest companies the obligation, at this stage with a requirement for limited assurance, begins as early as January 2025, for the 2024 fiscal year. The Commission plans to evaluate the shift from limited assurance to reasonable assurance no later than October 2028.

CSRD has a material extraterritorial impact. Large companies headquartered outside of the EU with listed equity and debt securities on an EU-regulated market are in general also captured by the CSRD reporting rules. Further, subsidiaries outside of the EU may need to provide sustainability information to parent companies based in the EU, in addition to complying with disclosure requirements prescribed by the jurisdiction in which they are incorporated.

### Enhanced CSDDD due diligence rules will also come into play

The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) is a major piece of EU legislation that will require large EU companies (those with a net global turnover of over €150m and more than 500 employees) and large non-EU companies (those with an EU-wide revenue of over €300m) to conduct environmental and human rights due diligence across their operations, subsidiaries and value chains already from 2027. The scope of the CSDDD will extend to more companies in the years to follow. We expect the compliance burden the CSDDD presents to be significant, especially for companies with extensive, international value chains. Consequently, the 2027 implementation date is challenging. The requirements of the CSDDD are expected to dovetail with CSRD and will also be the first piece of EU legislation that mandates companies to adopt a climate transition plan. Companies should consider whether they are looking at sustainability reporting holistically and understand the links between the CSRD and other regulatory requirements, such as the CSDDD, or the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU Taxonomy).

### Interoperability of European and international standardsis in focus for policymakers

Looking beyond the EU, international standards are also evolving. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) is expected to build on the two standards it published in 2023, with work underway on several topics: biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem services; human capital; human rights; and connectivity in reporting.

The ISSB has collaborated closely with the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) – the body responsible for creating the ESRS – to ensure that the ISSB standards and ESRS are consistent as far as possible, and to avoid duplication in reporting against both sets of standards. In 2024, EFRAG and the ISSB are expected to publish a table showing how the standards align and where incremental disclosures may be needed to meet both sets of standards. Several countries, including the UK, have committed to adopting the ISSB standards.

### Reporting on emerging topics

We expect clarity in 2024 on whether or how the finalised framework from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures will be implemented in EU and international reporting frameworks. We expect it to be incorporated into the ISSB. As a result, companies may choose to focus on broader environmental issues beyond their initial climate change disclosures and consider their capability to report on other emerging topics such as biodiversity or circularity, among others.

### Taxonomy reporting gains traction

The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that includes a reporting mechanism and criteria for economic activities that can be considered as environmentally sustainable. Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy requires companies in scope of CSRD to disclose information on how and to what extent their activities are associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities, considering metrics such as capital expenditures (CapEx), operating expenses and turnover. This information will also be subject to independent assurance as required by CSRD.

In 2024 companies affected by EU Taxonomy reporting rules should turn their attention towards improving their data frameworks and data quality with the aim of increasing over time their EU Taxonomy alignment. Further, they should consider how to use the EU Taxonomy as a tool to design their transition plans. The quality of a company’s transition plan could also have a direct impact on lenders and bond investors’ assessments of the riskiness of a company from a transition planning perspective. Beyond 2024, the EU Taxonomy sector coverage and list of sustainable activities will be expanded, bringing more companies into scope.

The EU Taxonomy currently covers 13 sectors. Significant industries are missing, among them agriculture. The sectors currently in scope include: Forestry; Environmental protection and restoration; Manufacturing; Energy; Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation; Transport; Construction and real estate; Information and communication; Professional, scientific, and technical activities; Financial and insurance activities; Education; Human health and social work activities; Arts, entertainment and recreation. However, companies in sectors not captured by the Taxonomy still have an obligation to report on their capital expenditure if they have investments in activities included in the Taxonomy.

Looking beyond the EU, new taxonomies are proliferating globally, with varying objectives and priorities, aligned with the characteristics of national economies. However, the EU Taxonomy, as the most expansive and advanced framework, is often seen as a source of inspiration for others. The UK, for example, is expected to align with the EU Taxonomy, albeit with some revisions to reflect local economy specificities. Companies operating globally should monitor the developments at national level and the effect they may have on their business operations. The International Platform on Sustainable Finance – a dedicated working group comprising public authorities across the globe – is expected to promote best practices and compare different taxonomies to identify opportunities for the mobilisation of private capital towards environmentally sustainable investments and any obstacles.

### What companies should do now

**Sustainability reporting is more than a compliance exercise.**

To respond fully to CSRD and the ESRS, companies need to consider how implementing the reporting requirements extends beyond the immediate compliance exercise and will drive broader changes to strategy, governance, operations, and data. In particular:

* **Embrace a strategic approach:** There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach. A business strategy that is both effective and cohesive should rely on the development of a suitable data framework that supports sustainable transformation of the business. In addition, a disclosure strategy embedding an understanding of the overall disclosure landscape will help firms to plan. Finance is likely to lead these projects but other parts of the business, such as procurement, accounting, legal, compliance, communication and human resources, should be involved.
* **Evaluate the governance structure:** Companies need to ensure they run an adequately resourced programme with appropriate governance in place, addressing key dependencies between different functions and projects. This extends to considering the relationship with boards of their subsidiaries that may need to sign off consolidated sustainability reports, depending on the reporting strategy taken at a group level. Given the broad impact of sustainability reporting requirements across all sectors, the skills required are likely to be in short supply.

* **Get ready for assurance and manage mis-reporting risks:** If they have not done so, companies should set up due diligence processes to identify and mitigate reporting risks in their supply chains. A closer look into engagement processes with their suppliers to ensure the transfer of information for reporting purposes is crucial. Companies should also allow sufficient time to build their internal capacity and test their assurance models. Investments made to upskill the organisation and embed relevant KPIs in the management and control cycle will pay off.

## Making circularity and circular design the norm

Circularity is evolving rapidly, driven both by consumer demand and new regulatory requirements.As recent research from Deloitte UK discusses, consumers are increasingly focusing on the circularity of products and services and are changing their behaviour in many areas.[1](#endnote-1) Some examples of these behavioural changes are set out below (Figure 3).

### Or copy link

Most legislative actions proposed under the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan have now been published by the Commission. They have either entered into force or are under consideration by the European Parliament and/or the European Council. Companies are in a position where they must determine how the regulations affect them and how best to prepare. For 2024 companies should focus on understanding what circular design means for their products and services and how best to incorporate new processes into their data and governance systems.

### Linking regulatory priorities to business concerns

The flagship regulations within the Circular Economy Action Plan are expected to enter into force ahead of the end of the current European Parliament this year. These include the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), Right to Repair, and Packaging and Packaging Waste (PPWR). The following table shows the expected timeline for the setting of targets and application requirements, alongside the timeline for CSRD.

### What is the link between circularity and CSRD?

Companies in scope of CSRD will have to report sustainability information using the ESRS developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG). ESRS 5 requires companies to report on resources use and circular economy action plans. EFRAG has also provided some detailed circularity metrics that could be used by companies. Further, sector-specific standards will be adopted by the EU in 2026. Companies should focus now on creating robust data frameworks that can be leveraged in future for detailed reporting as needed by sector-specific standards.

### Designing for circularity

ESPR will encompass a range of new product categories, including 12 end-use products such as textiles, cosmetic products and detergents, and seven intermediary products such as iron, steel and plastics, among others.[2](#endnote-2)The impact of ESPR on companies’ core operations is therefore expected to be significant. Beyond specific traceability elements, the requirements will directly affect products at all stages in the value chain, including recyclability, the use of recycled contents, and durability. Also, the legislative Right to Repair measure makes producers responsible for ensuring cost-efficient repair services are available to consumers post-sale, to extend the product’s life.[3](#endnote-3)

Together the regulations create new opportunities for companies throughout the product life cycle, such as sourcing (and eventually scaling) secondary material or components for production, designing products based on other companies’ waste

# Key Challenges in the Consumer Electronics Industry and How to Navigate Them

The consumer electronics market faces some challenges brought by disrupted supply chains, the pandemic, and economic downturn. Learn how the market cope.

No items found.

TABLE OF CONTENT

62 million tonnes of e-waste. Geopolitical conflicts disrupting access to essential components. Trade wars. Rising production costs. Labor shortages.These aren’t future risks — they’re the very real, very current challenges the consumer electronics industry is grappling with in 2025 and beyond.

Take this: in 2023 and 2024, global chip shortages delayed production of everything from laptops to dishwashers. If you tried ordering a MacBook, a Samsung washing machine, or even a PlayStation during this period, you may have faced unexpected delivery times, higher prices, or no availability at all.

For businesses, the impact was even greater — IT departments couldn’t source laptops for new employees, and schools had to delay digital learning programs. All because the global system couldn’t keep up.

And if you look beyond just device availability — toward how devices are used, maintained, and eventually disposed of — you'll notice another major shift underway: **government regulation**.

Take a look at the image below. We're pretty sure you are no stranger to these numbers. The global e-waste production continues to rise.

And as the waste piles up, so do the regulations. Governments around the world are no longer turning a blind eye to the environmental impact of discarded electronics. Policies are tightening, and accountability is shifting — from consumers back to the manufacturers.

Across the globe, lawmakers are putting pressure on manufacturers to take greater responsibility for the **entire lifecycle** of a device — not just the sale. A few examples:

* **The EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)**  
  Adopted in 2024, this regulation requires electronics to be built for **durability, repairability, and recyclability** — and come with a **Digital Product Passport** so you (or a technician) can actually understand what’s inside the device and how to fix it.
* **The EU Right to Repair Directive**  
  Ever been told it’s cheaper to replace your phone than to fix a cracked screen? This directive pushes back on that idea. Manufacturers must now offer **affordable repairs** and spare parts, making repair a real option — not just a checkbox on a website.
* **France’s Anti-Waste and Circular Economy Law**  
  France went a step further: companies are banned from destroying unsold electronics and must display a **repairability index** (yes, like a nutrition label — but for your smartphone). It helps consumers understand how fixable a product actually is before they buy it.
* **Global e-waste legislation**  
  With over 70 countries now enforcing e-waste rules, producers are increasingly being held accountable for **taking back old devices** and ensuring they don’t just end up in a landfill or someone’s bottom drawer.

Here's an illustration to summarise the [key challenges / moments in the consumer electronics and appliance manufacturing industry](http://www.circuly.io/blog/key-challenges-in-the-tech-and-consumer-electronics-industry).

Navigating these challenges will require a blend of strategic agility, a dash of sustainability, and a keen eye on what consumers really want.

## **It's All About Trust**

According to the 2022 Consumer Products Industry Outlook Research by [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/at/Documents/consumer-business/at-consumer-products-industry-outlook-2022.pdf), 9 out of 10 executives reported supply chain challenges as the biggest threat to growth. In addition, 6 out of 10 executives said issues with finding labor and increasing inflation as challenges they are already facing. Overcoming these challenges is becoming imperative not only in 2022 but in years to come, at least from the business owners' point of view.

> From their customers' point of view, things may look a bit different as their primary challenge revolves around one thing. Trust.

Trusting has always been hard, and knowing who to trust is even harder. It is the basis of every meaningful relationship, personal and business. In business, trust is developed through highly competent actions with the right intent for all involved parties. These actions then lead to increased reliability, transparency, and humanity.

Having this in mind and combining it with the aforementioned challenges that the consumer electronics industry is facing, it becomes obvious where most consumer electronics companies are standing today:

* Disruptions in the consumer electronics supply chain cause stockouts, which break the perception of reliable availability and damage the perception of both retailers and consumer electronics companies.
* Issues caused by labor shortages harm production and, in some cases, service quality which further impacts the perceived ability of companies to deliver as promised.
* Inflation that is increasing beyond what is seen as ""normal"" is breaking the promise of a fair deal.

If these challenges were not enough, factors such as shipping delays, greenwashing, lack of personalisation, and a general loss of trust in businesses are enough for consumer electronics businesses to focus on building trust with their customers.

‍

As seen in the image above, there are many challenges that consumer electronics companies need to address if they want to win the battle for their customers' trust.

## **Challenge #1: Consumer Electronics Supply Chain Disruption**

Although the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly contributed to the instability of consumer electronics supply chains, it is still one of the reasons behind it. In fact, Covid-19 just exacerbated existing issues with the supply chain.

Because of its over dependence on outsourcing, distant manufacturing, and reduced number of suppliers, consumer electronics supply chains have been experiencing difficulties for some time. The pandemic just brought these issues to the surface.

Although there was evidence that the disruption caused by the pandemic has started to slow down and return to normal, with new developments such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the geopolitical situation in the whole world, it is expected that the disruption of consumer electronics supply chains will continue in the years to come.

Demand for consumer electronics continues to outweigh supply, putting additional pressure on already pressured manufacturers.

Additionally, the switch to a hybrid way of working where more and more people are working from home has caused an increased demand for both business and consumer electronics.

According to the survey above conducted by Deloitte, 90% of business executives reported that their companies were facing significant problems with their consumer electronics supply chain.

‍

Issues they were reporting mainly were around securing products, getting them to market, and keeping enough of them in stock. And although some companies have managed to find a workaround, most say that the problem with their supply chains will extend through the entire 2022 and will likely continue in the coming years.

## **Challenge #2: Labor shortages and the future of work**

Concurrent consumer electronics supply chain issues worsen the problem, including workforce shortages and the backlog of shipping containers worldwide.

For example, on February 2022, the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, which some report are responsible for most delays, had 101 ships waiting to unload compared to only 40 on the same day year before.

With labor shortages that significantly affect product quality and timely deliveries, the consumer electronics industry is facing yet another problem related to the workforce. New technologies, sources of talent, and recent events, such as the pandemic, have changed and continue to change the very nature of work.

More and more employees are switching to non-traditional forms of employment. They decide to retire early, start their own business, or simply choose to take a break from work.

This leads businesses across industries struggling to meet customer demand.

This unprecedented labor shortage, often called the Great Attrition, has led companies to act quickly. Most consumer electronics companies are already taking action to combat the problem. Companies are trying to create a more attractive, engaging, and sustainable work environment to turn the Great Attrition into the Great Attraction.

And although some of them are successful, the challenge of labor shortage has already taken its toll as wages continue to rise and inflation continues to spin out of control.

If these issues persist in the long-term, they will undoubtedly hurt GDP growth, deepen an already deep recession, and cripple any future expansion plans in the whole sector.

## **Challenge #3: Rising inflation in unpredictable times**

What goes up must come down. While the prices will have to go down at some point, there is currently no sign of when that will happen. What consumer electronics companies realize now more than ever is the difference between gross profit and gross margin.

Raising prices increases revenue and shows that the company is growing but that growth makes little sense when companies increase their costs without keeping a close eye on their gross margin. This growth is artificial and makes companies less profitable which, in turn, destroys shareholder value.

It is safe to say that inflation has become our reality, and consumer electronics companies that have been disciplined in capturing cost increases and passing them on to their customers will have to find a way around this challenge.

One of the best ways for consumer electronics companies to overcome this challenge and maintain the profit margin is to strengthen their relationship with customers and increase their trust by showing them that they care and that they are willing to go the extra mile by offering services that ease the burden their customers have from facing the same challenge.

## **Challenge #4: Sustainability and Regulatory Compliance**

The consumer electronics industry faces a pressing challenge in sustainability and regulatory compliance as global demand for greener practices grows and governments implement stricter environmental regulations. The push towards sustainability involves reducing carbon footprints, minimising electronic waste (e-waste), and ensuring ethical supply chain practices.

### Sustainability Initiatives

Consumer electronics companies are increasingly under scrutiny to adopt sustainable practices throughout their operations. This includes:

* **Product Design:** Developing products that are energy-efficient, durable, and easier to repair to extend their lifespan.
* **Material Sourcing:** Ensuring responsible sourcing of raw materials, including conflict-free minerals and sustainable packaging.
* **Recycling Programs:** Implementing effective recycling programs to reduce the environmental impact of discarded electronics.

### Regulatory Compliance

Governments worldwide are tightening regulations on electronic waste management and product recycling. Challenges include:

* **E-Waste Regulations:** Compliance with laws requiring manufacturers to take responsibility for the end-of-life disposal of their products.
* **Energy Efficiency Standards:** Meeting stringent energy efficiency standards set by regulatory bodies.
* **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):** Fulfilling obligations under EPR schemes, which require manufacturers to finance and manage the recycling of their products.

### Industry Response

In response to these challenges, consumer electronics companies are:

* **Investing in R&D:** Innovating towards more sustainable materials and manufacturing processes.
* **Collaborating Across the Supply Chain:** Working with suppliers and partners to ensure sustainable practices are upheld.
* **Educating Consumers:** Raising awareness among consumers about the importance of recycling and sustainable product choices.

## **Circular Business Model: The Future of the Consumer Electronics Industry**

It goes without saying that electronics have transformed the way of working and living. And it will continue to do so because today's global consumer electronics market is valued at an estimated US$1 trillion. Various projections say that it will continue to grow despite the above mentioned challenges.   
As the world population continues to grow and welfare continues to increase, consumption of natural resources is also increasing. This increases the pressure on both our resources and the environment.

> A well-known economist Kenneth Boulding once said: ""Anyone who thinks that they can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist.""

Similarly, in its 1972 famous report ""Limits to growth,"" the Club of Rome confirmed Boulding's words that our resources are limited. Still, it also offered some suggestions on developing ways to live inside the boundaries of those limitations.

One of the essential steps to ""overcome"" those limitations is to switch our economic activities from the linear economy model to a circular economy model. And while circular economy activities in the consumer electronics industry focus mainly on logistics, recycling, and energy efficiency in the production and design phase, one emerging activity that offers great potential is a leasing or subscription business model.

## The Necessity of an Access-Based Business Model

With the [subscription-based business model](https://www.circuly.io/blog/products-business-perfect-launching-a-subscription-business-model), consumer electronics companies offer their products or devices as a service. Although still in its infancy, device-as-a-service or [product-as-a-service](https://circuly.io/blog/product-as-a-service), in general, is quickly gaining foothold because of how well it solves some of the challenges faced by the consumer electronics industry. This innovative business model indeed builds trust between companies and customers.

In a [device-as-a-service model](https://www.circuly.io/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-device-as-a-service), the customer does not become an owner of the product but uses it as a paid service, enabling them to use the device without having to worry about device management.

When done properly, DaaS business model deepens the relationship between the customer and the device provider and increases trust. On the other hand, it simplifies the consumer electronics supply chain. It offers new revenue opportunities by lowering warranty and sourcing costs as devices can be redeployed after the initial device as a service subscription period has ended.

Aside from the customer and business benefits, there are benefits for the environment since the device as a service business model is based on the fact that device are refurbished and redeployed again, which reduces the amount of electronic waste and saves resources and energy.

# Key Challenges in the Consumer Electronics Industry and How to Navigate Them

August 25, 2022

Dino Paic

62 million tonnes of e-waste. Geopolitical conflicts disrupting access to essential components. Trade wars. Rising production costs. Labor shortages.These aren’t future risks — they’re the very real, very current challenges the consumer electronics industry is grappling with in 2025 and beyond.

Take this: in 2023 and 2024, global chip shortages delayed production of everything from laptops to dishwashers. If you tried ordering a MacBook, a Samsung washing machine, or even a PlayStation during this period, you may have faced unexpected delivery times, higher prices, or no availability at all.

For businesses, the impact was even greater — IT departments couldn’t source laptops for new employees, and schools had to delay digital learning programs. All because the global system couldn’t keep up.

And if you look beyond just device availability — toward how devices are used, maintained, and eventually disposed of — you'll notice another major shift underway: **government regulation**.

Take a look at the image below. We're pretty sure you are no stranger to these numbers. The global e-waste production continues to rise.

And as the waste piles up, so do the regulations. Governments around the world are no longer turning a blind eye to the environmental impact of discarded electronics. Policies are tightening, and accountability is shifting — from consumers back to the manufacturers.

Across the globe, lawmakers are putting pressure on manufacturers to take greater responsibility for the **entire lifecycle** of a device — not just the sale. A few examples:

* **The EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)**  
  Adopted in 2024, this regulation requires electronics to be built for **durability, repairability, and recyclability** — and come with a **Digital Product Passport** so you (or a technician) can actually understand what’s inside the device and how to fix it.
* **The EU Right to Repair Directive**  
  Ever been told it’s cheaper to replace your phone than to fix a cracked screen? This directive pushes back on that idea. Manufacturers must now offer **affordable repairs** and spare parts, making repair a real option — not just a checkbox on a website.
* **France’s Anti-Waste and Circular Economy Law**  
  France went a step further: companies are banned from destroying unsold electronics and must display a **repairability index** (yes, like a nutrition label — but for your smartphone). It helps consumers understand how fixable a product actually is before they buy it.
* **Global e-waste legislation**  
  With over 70 countries now enforcing e-waste rules, producers are increasingly being held accountable for **taking back old devices** and ensuring they don’t just end up in a landfill or someone’s bottom drawer.

Here's an illustration to summarise the [key challenges / moments in the consumer electronics and appliance manufacturing industry](http://www.circuly.io/blog/key-challenges-in-the-tech-and-consumer-electronics-industry).

Navigating these challenges will require a blend of strategic agility, a dash of sustainability, and a keen eye on what consumers really want.

## **It's All About Trust**

According to the 2022 Consumer Products Industry Outlook Research by [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/at/Documents/consumer-business/at-consumer-products-industry-outlook-2022.pdf), 9 out of 10 executives reported supply chain challenges as the biggest threat to growth. In addition, 6 out of 10 executives said issues with finding labor and increasing inflation as challenges they are already facing. Overcoming these challenges is becoming imperative not only in 2022 but in years to come, at least from the business owners' point of

**Are you working in the electronics & IT sector? These are sectors with a significant environmental impact, but also areas with vast opportunities for sustainability improvements. In the coming years, more and more (international) legislation will affect businesses. Some of this legislation is specifically aimed at the electronics & IT sector, while other parts will apply to all sectors. In this article, we outline the key pieces of sustainability legislation relevant to you.**

## Digital Product Passport

[The Digital Product Passport (DPP)](https://gs1.eu/activities/digital-product-passport/) will become mandatory for products placed on the EU market, and consumer electronics are one of the first product categories that will be required to adopt this passport.

‍

The Digital Product Passport is a label you must attach to your products. It contains detailed environmental information throughout the product's lifecycle, making this environmental information accessible to everyone interested in the sustainability of the product, including consumers, customers, investors, or government agencies.

‍

The following information must be included on the digital product passport:

* Information on sustainable performance
* Traceability
* Declaration of conformity
* Technical documentation
* User manuals
* Information about the manufacturer, importer, or authorized representative.

‍

The goal of the DPP is to enhance transparency and make products and materials traceable. This allows them to be utilized, designed, and used in a circular and sustainable manner.

‍

Additionally, the passport combats greenwashing: by mandating transparency about the origin of a product's materials, it becomes harder to make false or unfounded sustainability claims.

‍

The introduction of the digital product passport is expected following the final approval of the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) in 2024. It will be mandatory for both products manufactured within the EU and those imported.

## Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE)

The volume of electronic waste, also known as e-waste, is rapidly increasing and is the fastest growing waste stream globally. This waste comprises a variety of devices such as mobile phones, computers, televisions, as well as refrigerators, household appliances, lamps, medical devices, and solar panels.

‍

[The Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee_en), the WEEE Directive, focuses on the collection, recycling, and reuse of this electronic waste. Companies are required to ensure the proper disposal of discarded electronic devices and are encouraged to increase recycling rates.

‍

The objective of the WEEE is to contribute to sustainable production and consumption by:

* Preventing the generation of electronic waste
* Contributing to the efficient use of resources and the recovery of secondary raw materials through reuse, recycling, and other recovery methods
* Enhancing the environmental performance of all those involved in the lifecycle of electrical and electronic equipment

‍

By improving the collection, treatment, and recycling of electronic devices at the end of their life, resource efficiency can be increased and the transition to a circular economy can be supported.

‍

## Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive

[The Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive_en), or RoHS Directive, limits the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. This includes heavy metals, flame retardants, and plasticizers.

‍

Its aim is to reduce environmental impact and protect public health by preventing these substances from entering the environment. The RoHS Directive ensures that hazardous substances are replaced with safer alternatives.

‍

Thus, the directive promotes the recyclability of electronic devices, as these devices and their components contain fewer hazardous substances. At the same time, it ensures a level playing field for manufacturers and importers of electronic devices in the European market.

## Critical Raw Materials Act

""Critical Raw Materials"" are resources that are scarce because they are difficult to extract and are needed for a wide range of applications. For instance, lithium, cobalt, and nickel are used in battery production; gallium is used in solar panels; and boron in wind technologies.

‍

To continue meeting the demand for these resources safely and sustainably, the EU has introduced [The Critical Raw Materials Act.](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/green-deal-industrial-plan/european-critical-raw-materials-act_en) This initiative aims to reduce the EU's dependence on imports of these materials from other parts of the world.

‍

The European Critical Raw Materials Act also impacts organisations in the IT & electronics sector with its goals:

‍

**1.  Strengthening various stages of the value chain for strategic raw materials**

**‍**This includes the following allocations:

* At least 10% of the EU's annual need for these raw materials must come from domestic extraction.
* 40% of the required processing of these raw materials must take place within the EU.
* 15% of the recycling of these raw materials must be performed within the EU.

‍

**2. Diversifying imports of strategic raw materials**The goal is to be less dependent on specific other countries, with no single country providing more than 65% of the EU's annual consumption of a specific strategic raw material by 2030.

‍

**3. Improving monitoring and mitigation of supply risks associated with critical raw materials.**

‍

**4. Ensuring the free movement of critical raw materials and products containing them in the Union market.**This is aimed at enhancing circularity and sustainability, thereby ensuring a high level of environmental protection.

‍

## **CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)**

**‍**Another upcoming legislation is the CSRD. You might have heard about it; it's getting a lot of attention across the business world. Introduced by the European Union, the CSRD aims to strengthen and expand the requirements for corporate sustainability reporting. The goal is to enhance transparency, accountability, and sustainable practices among all European companies.

‍

The first companies need to comply with the CSRD legislation starting in 2025. This means these companies need to start monitoring their impact from 2024, otherwise, they will have nothing to report.

‍

The companies that must first comply with the CSRD are organisations that:

* Have more than 250 employees
* Have a turnover exceeding €50 million
* Have a balance sheet total exceeding €25 million

‍

And from 2027, all companies based in the EU (with more than 10 employees) must report according to the CSRD.

‍

Our tip: don't leave the CSRD as something to fix at the last minute. Start early. The sooner, the better. Read [our article on the CSRD](https://www.hhc.earth/knowledge-base/csrd-everything-you-need-to-know) to learn more about the implementation of this legislation and get tips on how to get started.

‍

## **Legislation on communicating your sustainable performance**

**‍**The European Union has laws to protect consumers from being misled by producers and to enable them to make informed choices about their purchases. These laws are the Green Claims Directive and the Directive on Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition.

‍

According to these directives:

* General environmental claims and other misleading product information are prohibited.
* Sustainability claims must be substantiated through environmental impact studies (such as an LCA).
* Sustainability labels are only allowed if they are based on recognized certification programs or introduced by a governmental body.
* Information about warranties must be clearly displayed, and a new label is introduced for products with an extended warranty period.

‍

We will further explain both directives below.

### **Green Claims Directive**

**‍**[The Green Claims Directive](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/green-claims_en) promotes transparency and honesty in environmental claims. This directive requires all companies to provide clear and substantiated information about the environmental benefits of their products, which is essential for building consumer trust and preventing greenwashing.

‍

This directive complements the ESPR and CSRD, and strengthens the EU's efforts to create a more reliable market for sustainable products.

### **Directive on Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition**

[**‍**The Directive on Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-empowering-consumers-green-transition-and-annex_en) aims to provide consumers with reliable, accessible, and understandable information about the sustainability of products. With the requirement for clear information provision, companies must be able to convincingly demonstrate why their products or services are considered 'sustainable,' in a way that is verifiable and not misleading.

### Key Insights

The eco-friendly electronics market is poised for remarkable expansion, projected to reach an estimated **$20.66 billion** by 2025. This growth is fueled by a robust **CAGR of 22.9%** throughout the forecast period of 2025-2033, indicating a significant upward trajectory. Consumer demand for sustainable products is escalating, driven by increasing environmental awareness and regulatory pressures on manufacturers to adopt greener practices. This surge in demand is particularly evident in segments like consumer electronics and household appliances, where consumers are actively seeking out devices with reduced environmental impact, such as those with lower energy consumption, recycled materials, and extended lifespans. The market is also benefiting from technological advancements that enable more sustainable production processes and the development of innovative eco-friendly materials.

The market's expansion is further supported by the growing recognition of the long-term economic benefits of sustainability, including reduced operational costs and enhanced brand reputation. Major players like Dell, HP, Apple, Samsung, and LG are heavily investing in research and development to introduce more sustainable product lines and implement circular economy principles, such as repairability and recyclability. While the market is experiencing strong growth, certain restraints, such as the higher initial cost of some eco-friendly components and the complexities of global e-waste management, need to be addressed. Nevertheless, the overarching trend towards conscious consumerism and corporate responsibility in the electronics industry paints a very positive outlook for the eco-friendly electronics market, with significant opportunities across all major regions, especially in Asia Pacific, North America, and Europe, which are expected to lead in both adoption and innovation.

### Eco-Friendly Electronics Concentration & Characteristics

The eco-friendly electronics landscape is characterized by a growing concentration of innovation in specific areas, primarily driven by consumer demand for sustainable products and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Key concentration areas include the use of recycled materials (e.g., post-consumer plastics, rare earth metals), energy-efficient designs reducing operational power consumption, and modular product architectures that facilitate repair and upgrades, thereby extending product lifespans. The impact of regulations, such as the EU's RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) directives, is profoundly shaping manufacturing processes and product lifecycles, pushing companies to invest in greener technologies.

Product substitutes are emerging, though often in nascent stages. For instance, the shift towards cloud-based services and software updates can reduce the need for frequent hardware upgrades. Furthermore, the rise of refurbished and second-hand electronics markets offers a direct substitute to new, albeit less eco-friendly, devices. End-user concentration is notable within younger demographics and environmentally conscious consumer segments, particularly in developed economies.

Raw Content: INSIDE LOOK: SUSTAINABILITY AND DESIGN TRENDS IN THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY New research provides insights on the current changes and growth of sustainability 2 Table of Contents Executive Summary Market Forces Driving Sustainability in Consumer Electronics Industry Research Findings - Part 1: 6 Key Insights on Adoption of Sustainability in Consumer Electronics Industry 03 Research Findings - Part 2: Overcoming Sustainability Challenges 15 Conclusion CONTENTS 04 07 22 25 27 Research Findings - Part 4: Role of CAD in Consumer Electronics Industry Adoption and Growth of Sustainability Research Findings - Part 3: Key Initiatives for Sustainability Growth in Consumer Electronics Industry 3 Executive Summary Autodesk commissioned a recent research study to understand more fully the current dynamics of the consumer electronics industry and sustainability — especially in the face of shifting market forces such as supply chain challenges, evolving consumer demand, and government regulations. Interviews with 20 high-level, consumer-electronics product designers, engineers, and sustainability consultants and officers provide a new understanding about their views and the role of sustainable practices in both their organizations and day-to-day roles. All responses are anonymous for honest, unfiltered feedback. Key themes, take-aways, and actions surfaced from the research. Experts in the consumer electronics industry have shown the willingness and ability to adopt sustainable practices, but there is still room for improvement. An increased focus on sustainability by the consumer electronics industry is widely viewed as underway, but the implementation of sustainable best practices continues to compete with other priorities and the bottom line. The research found strong agreement that laws and regulation will move the needle to prioritize and act with sustainability in mind. The research revealed some of the most challenging aspects that still need to be addressed. Sourcing and using trusted and less expensive sustainable materials remain problematic. Total carbon management and calculation of lifecycle analysis (LCA) are also difficult. Designers see the need to carve out more of an emphasis on design for emotional connection and the circular economy. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Respondents were also asked to share their thoughts on the key initiatives required to drive sustainability growth. The following ranked as the most important areas to pursue: manufacturing optimization, simplifying design, and compliance and certification. According to the European Commission, it’s estimated that 80% of all product-related environmental impacts are determined in the design phase. Software can help mitigate this impact. However, there is a limited awareness about how CAD can help to design more sustainable products. A need for further awareness, understanding, and ongoing education about driving sustainable outcomes using CAD is critical. Sustainable design practices are becoming a mandate within the design and manufacturing industry. What was once considered an internal business or socially responsible decision has now shifted to an essential component of business legitimacy and success. External forces—such as government regulation, consumer demand, access to capital, and need for supply chain resilience—are positioning sustainable practices as non-negotiable. Market Forces Driving Sustainability in Consumer Electronics Industry CONSUMER DEMAND Consumers increasingly seek products and brands that align with their values and a company’s commitment to sustainability is paramount. Consumers are also demanding more transparency especially as greenwashing has become apparent. Companies that meet these new demands can see a positive impact on sales and, ultimately, the bottom line. According to Sebastian Glatzer at McKinsey, “Across consumer categories, those marketed as sustainable have been growing five to six times faster than the average market. Also, sustainable products come at a high price premium. Consumers say they’re willing to pay a little or even a lot more if they know that those products have been sustainably sourced and produced.” US $3.5 billion in new sales wins in 2021 where Sustainable Impact was an influencing factor.

MARKET FORCES DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY 4 Consumer Financial Regulatory Supply Chain 5 REGULATIONS Around the world, countries are adopting new initiatives to fight climate change. That means government regulations also continue to change and grow. While global standardization will make significant progress, local and regional norms will flourish due to geographic uniqueness, placement in the global economy, local politics, and more. In turn, independent environmental certification agencies and third-party consumer auditing firms will grow due to increasing regulations and accountability. Grassroots efforts are also shaping new regulations. The “right to repair” movement advocates for consumers to have the legal right to repair and maintain their own electronics, as well as the ability to access the tools, information, and replacement parts needed to do so. The EU Charger regulation promotes the idea of standardization in electronics. By reducing the number of chargers required for different devices, the regulation both promotes more sustainable electronics and reduces the amount of electronic waste generated by consumers. FINANCIAL Due to climate change and the inherent business impact, financial services and insurance industries are making new adjustments. Financial services and investment firms, such as BlackRock, increasingly include ESG criteria to evaluate companies, forcing traditional players to evolve. Institutional investors are divesting from assets with significant material risks such as coal mines and oil/gas wells as they develop sustainable portfolios and new environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics. Finance is now being channeled to more sustainable companies through ESG funds or sustainability- linked loans. Investors are also exerting pressure on executives and boards to make their companies more sustainable. Pressure is being exerted at the very top as well. According to Merel Spierings, a researcher for the ESG Center at The Conference Board, MARKET FORCES DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY “The majority of S&P 500 companies are now tying executive compensation to some form of ESG performance—growing from 66 percent in 2020 to 73 percent in 2021. As a result of the ever-growing attention to climate change, the share of S&P 500 companies that tied carbon footprint and emission reduction goals to executive pay also grew considerably, from 10 percent in 2020 to 19 percent in 2021.” 90% $50B Explosive Growth of ESG Investment $50 billion by 2025 from about $35 trillion due to concerns about climate change and other societal issues.
Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Insurance companies are increasingly investing in renewable energy and other sustainable technologies to reduce their exposure to fossil fuels and other high-carbon assets that contribute to climate change. This shift in investment strategy is in line with efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Cities and local governments are also suing oil companies for damages resulting from the impacts of climate change. A recent lawsuit from the state of Delaware claims that oil companies have contributed to climate change and have misled the public about the risks associated with fossil fuel use. SUPPLY CHAIN The COVID pandemic delivered the biggest and broadest supply chain shock in recent memory. But it is only the latest in a series of disruptions— especially when it comes to climate change. According to McKinsey Global Institute’s “Risk, Resilience, and Rebalancing in Global Value Chains,” “Changes in the environment and in the global economy are increasing the frequency and magnitude of shocks. Forty weather disasters in 2019 caused damages exceeding $1 billion each— and in recent years, the economic toll caused by the most extreme events has been escalating.” New manufacturing methods are being pursued and companies will pivot to a trusted, multi-local operating model. Sustainable procurement creates a new opportunity for collaboration across industries. Leveraging existing technologies—while tapping into emerging tech such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML)—can significantly accelerate sustainable procurement through real-time data, information transparency, and the ability to see trends and create forecasts with sustainability in mind. For example, IoT can drive sustainable outcomes like resource efficiency and waste reduction with smart home devices. These IoT automatic adjustments to heating and cooling help reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Source: EPA Center for Corporate Leadership MARKET FORCES DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY 6 Impact of Supply Chain and Greenhouse Gas Emissions “Organizations’ supply chains often account for more than 90% percent of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, when taking into account their overall climate impacts.” In the face of these market forces, consumer electronics companies know sustainability is a major disrupter. While many are embracing sustainability, the approach varies in scope and magnitude. Some companies have sustainability embedded in their mission, while others are just thinking about introducing it. Here are six of their key insights from the study. All respondents’ answers are anonymous to provide open feedback. 7 6 Key Insights on Adoption of Sustainability in the Consumer Electronics Industry But what do consumer electronics designers and engineers really think about the adoption of sustainability in the industry? An in-depth research study of 20 industrial designers, mechanical engineers, and sustainability consultants reveals both the personal and professional challenges to adopting sustainability. They understand the urgency and openly take pride in work that reflects their personal values and passion for sustainability. However, they feel there are still substantial barriers to making truly sustainable products. 1. INCREASED FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY BY CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY Across the board, respondents have seen more focus on the importance of sustainability over recent years. This is especially evident with the prioritization of material choices and reducing the overall impact of a product’s carbon footprint. “In the last ten years, the vast majority of projects we’ve encountered have been focusing on reduction of carbon footprint, domestic production, end-of-life designs, and material innovations to cut the amount of petroleum-based materials.” Designer @ Architectural Design Studio RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 “I’ve personally noticed a strong shift in the last 2-3 years, and every project I did in recent years had a sustainability ask or component to it. Whereas just 4-5 years ago that was not the case, and sustainability or eco materials were taken less seriously.” Designer @ Scandinavian Innovation Agency 8 9 2. SELF-REFLECTION AND IMPLICATIONS OF DESIGN AND SUSTAINABILITY Whether it’s the use of fossil fuels for manufacturing or the choice of materials, designers are taking a step back to view the scale of the industry’s impact on climate change. “One of the things that relates to sustainability that I have thought much more about over the past few years is how much waste there is particularly in terms of plastic parts or assemblies we design that can’t be recycled and eventually land in a landfill. When you consider that we are selling millions of products each year, it really does make me step back and realize the negative environmental aspect to what we do.” Engineer @ Audio Manufacturing Company 3. DIFFERING APPROACHES TO SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP AND ROLES While some consumer electronics companies create a dedicated sustainability leadership role, most take a less formal approach with efforts driven by project or client demands. “I work with many kinds of organizations. Some have sustainability reporting to the CEO, some to marketing, ops, finance, government affairs, etc. You learn a lot about a company’s sustainability priorities by seeing where it sits in the org.” Sustainability Consultant “Sustainability is managed throughout the company with oversight extending from the sustainability team and council to senior executives and, at the highest level, to the board of directors.” Chief Sustainability Officer @ Electronic Manufacturing Company RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 4. EVALUATION OF SUSTAINABILITY IN PARALLEL WITH OTHER PRIORITIES Startups typically have one goal: Get the product launched and out the door. Often, sustainability efforts take a back seat when considering and prioritizing cost, compliance, or process. “While I work for a sustainability focused company in its mission, I don’t necessarily think that our current design decisions are always driven by sustainability choices. We’re largely focused on solving autonomous driving technology and eventually having impacts in environmental sustainability. But solving autonomy takes priority over sustainability currently. Necessity to innovate prioritizes getting the product out there before optimizing the process and carbon impact. Design first, optimize (and sustain-ify) later.” Engineer @ Automotive Start-up “Not currently at my company because it’s a startup that focuses on making things work first. But definitely and increasingly prioritized at more mature companies like Google (where I used to work) and consumer electronics industry in general.” Engineer @ Fitness Start-up 10 11 5. BOTTOM LINE STILL WINS Consumer electronics companies remain concerned with the bottom line. If sustainability efforts cost more or cause significant delays in product development, then they often get shelved. “From a business perspective we have not yet reached the tipping point where there is a benefit to designing sustainable products so it will need to be driven by personal ambition. We want to do so but it needs alignment of the complete value chain from being at least cost neutral to being risk reduced to being commonly known throughout engineering and PM top being easy to source and second source. Our priority and opportunity are to highlight the social cost of what we produce and limit the impact. I am not sure that is enough. We need an industry to change. It’ll need the cost carrot or the cost stick.” Designer @ Creative Consultancy RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 “Most companies are trying to save money, but every now and then you get a Patagonia who on a brand level wants to prioritize sustainability at every level possible.” Designer @ Global Technology Design Group 12 13 6. LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE Overwhelmingly, consumer electronics designers and engineers believe that change will come through laws or taxes. They are the catalyst to take sustainability objectives from “nice to do” to “must do.” “I hope for legislation that will force an industries hand, such as the PVC ban or the European ‘right to repair’ bill.” Designer @ Creative Consultancy “The only real external forces would be consumers with their wallets and regulations requiring a more sustainable solutions to development.” Engineer @ Audio Manufacturing Company “I’m assuming it’s a culmination of a few factors why that shift is happening. One being new generations of consumers (Gen Z and others) growing up with a heightened sense for sustainability and ecological awareness. We also see incoming legislation in the EU (‘right to repair’). I think many brands now realize they need to act if they want to resonate with consumers of tomorrow and not be subject to penalties once new laws are in place.” Designer @ Scandinavian Innovation Company RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 “In a free market it’s difficult to drive these changes. Legislation or more PR focus on these types of decisions would be the only way to swing that balance.” Engineer @ Automotive Start-up RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 1 14 PulPac is on a mission to replace single-use plastics globally with its ground-breaking manufacturing technology for low-cost, high-performance fiber-based packaging and single-use products. PulPac focused on sustainability throughout their design and manufacturing processes and realized a host of positive outcomes, including energy and material cost savings, faster product design, and more durable and resilient products. “Single-use plastics are overengineered. They don’t break down. A coffee cup will last three hundred years when it’s needed for five minutes, so every day, we are adding millions of these cups into the system.” Viktor Börjesson, Chief Partnership Officer, PULPAC Image courtesy of PulPac 15 “Most companies will continue creating products from petroleum-based polymers and urethanes. They will mostly be from virgin materials and be un-sustainable and un-recyclable. Some however will lead the way and show business that products can be made with post-consumer waste, be sustainable and recyclable, and make healthy profits.” Designer @ Digital Health Care Company RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 2 Overcoming Sustainability Challenges While the consumer electronics industry clearly wants to do more, designing more sustainable products also provides its own unique challenges. Here, respondents shared the most challenging aspects that still need to be addressed. TRUSTED AND LESS EXPENSIVE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS Designers are excited to discover and use more sustainable materials. But adoption of using these materials—such as post-consumer waste— continues to lag. This is mainly due to the lack of trusted sources for these materials, expense from recycling costs, or fear of inconsistencies with color, texture, durability, and more. RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 2 UK-based PEMBREE uses Fusion to design and manufacture a growing range of mountain bike components.
“All our products are designed with sustainability in mind and are 100% carbon balanced,” says Phil Law, founder, and product designer, PEMBREE. “This goes beyond design, manufacture, and sourcing of materials to include the cost of consumables and packaging all the way through to final delivery. Our pedals are 99.9% recyclable and everything we do at PEMBREE is carbon neutral.” 16 Image courtesy of PEMBREE TOTAL CARBON MANAGEMENT Total carbon management (TCM) relates to the measurement and minimization of embodied and operational carbon in the design and make process. It’s urgent to reduce carbon emissions—yet TCM is difficult to estimate and perform. “The most relevant/urgent in my personal view is total carbon management. This feels like it could be a nice metric to judge one design over another and possibly lead to larger changes in the industry. However, it seems really, really hard to implement at the early design stages I’m usually concerned with. Early on, I don’t always know exactly all the parts that will be going into a product. Lots of unknowns.” Designer @ Global Technology Design Group Image courtesy of PEMBREE Image courtesy of PEMBREE DESIGNING FOR EMOTIONAL CONNECTION Designing for emotional connection means creating a more durable, quality product—and one that the consumer will treasure and not be so quick to throw away.
“Making a quality, long lasting product is something more and more clients are interested in as opposed to shorter lifespan/mass-produced cheap ones. Even trends in electronics are embracing a DIY aesthetic that encourages people to re-use things, repair them, and make them build a stronger connection to the objects— hopefully making those things less disposable.” Designer @ Product Engineering and Design Group RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 2 17 18 WHILL is exploring the latest technologies to develop even smarter designs by lightweighting mobility devices with generative design to empower users with even greater mobility and style. The WHILL team had to consider what materials to use to ensure they’re strong, lightweight, and cost-effective enough to meet the customer requirements. Image courtesy of WHILL “I think our design embodies the essence of generative design,” says Yoshihiro Hirata, head of WHILL’s Vehicle development group. “We were able to lighten the frame alone by more than 30%.” RESEARCH FINDINGS – PART 2 According to the World Economic Forum, a circular economy is “an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design.” 19 DESIGNING FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY The circular economy is the ultimate example of sustainability as it accounts for the product’s entire life span. It is also the most difficult to pursue. “Designing for a circular economy is the most desirable and impactful, but it requires the most systemic change and needs committed advocates within the client’s organization. A project must be set up by the client to specifically target those systemic changes in order

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles continued to gain momentum in 2024, shaping corporate strategies, regulatory frameworks, and stakeholder expectations worldwide. This year saw significant advancements in regulations, technological integration, and metrics standardization.

However, these developments were accompanied by challenges, such as data inconsistencies, rising costs, geopolitical tensions, and legal disputes. Regional disparities in ESG adoption became increasingly evident, with the EU pressing forward with robust ESG frameworks while the United States grappled with significant political resistance and legal challenges.

Let’s compare and contrast the paths ESG has taken in the two regions this past year, and how those differences will likely shape the outlook for ESG in the U.S. and the EU in 2025 and beyond.

### 1. Strengthening ESG Regulations and Standards

Regulatory frameworks around ESG became increasingly stringent in 2024, reflecting global efforts to align business practices with sustainability goals.

* **European Union Leadership**: The EU solidified its position as a global leader in ESG regulation by pressing forward with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). This directive mandates extensive disclosures, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity impacts, sustainability impacts, ecosystem restoration initiatives, and social responsibility. Under the directive, covered EU and non-EU companies are required to disclose adverse environment and human rights impacts and are required to develop climate change mitigation plans. Despite economic uncertainties, the EU maintained its commitment to advancing ESG, signaling that sustainability is non-negotiable in its policy agenda.
* **U.S. SEC Climate Disclosure Rule**: In contrast to the EU’s firm regulatory approach, the U.S. faced significant pushback as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finalized its climate disclosure rules. While the rules mandated reporting on emissions, climate risks, and certain diversity metrics, they immediately sparked lawsuits from business groups and Republican-led states, reflecting deep polarization over ESG and climate disclosures in the U.S. regulatory environment.
* **Emerging Markets Stepping Up**: Emerging economies began to play a larger role in ESG regulation. Brazil strengthened anti-deforestation laws to preserve the Amazon and protect biodiversity, while India introduced tax incentives for renewable energy, biodiversity restoration projects, and waste management technologies. These actions signaled a growing global consensus on the importance of ESG integration.

### 2. Technological Integration into ESG Strategies

Technology continued to play a transformative role in advancing ESG objectives in 2024, with new tools enhancing data collection, analysis and reporting.

* **AI for Predictive Insights**: Artificial intelligence (AI) became a critical tool for analyzing vast datasets, identifying inefficiencies, and predicting risks. AI also enabled companies to model potential climate impacts on their operations, helping them prepare for and mitigate risks.
* **Blockchain for Transparency**: Blockchain technology gained traction for verifying ESG claims such as ethical sourcing, carbon offsets, and supply chain traceability. By creating immutable digital records, blockchain reduces risk of fraud and greenwashing, increasing trust among stakeholders.
* **IoT for Real-Time Monitoring**: Internet of Things (IoT) devices provided granular, real-time data on emissions, water usage, energy consumption, and biodiversity monitoring in industrial and agricultural areas. These insights allowed companies to track progress against their ESG targets and optimize resource efficiency.
* **Carbon Accounting Innovations**: Advanced platforms for tracking carbon footprints, including Scope 3 emissions, allowed companies to measure and manage their impact more accurately. These tools were especially critical for organizations aiming to meet net-zero commitments.
* **Collaborative Digital Platforms**: Platforms connecting suppliers, regulators, and companies facilitated seamless data sharing and collective problem-solving, improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of ESG reporting.

### 3. Evolving Metrics and Reporting Practices

Efforts to standardize ESG metrics accelerated in 2024, addressing inconsistencies that had long hindered comparability and credibility. However, regional differences in regulatory priorities became increasingly evident, particularly in the treatment of materiality.

* **Global Standards Harmonization**: The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) continued its efforts to consolidate frameworks from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The ISSB’s standards primarily focus on enterprise value, aligning materiality definitions with financial impact. This approach has gained traction globally but there continue to be issues with the interoperability of ISSB and EU materiality requirements.
* **Double Materiality in the EU**: The CSRD stands out for its explicit inclusion of double materiality. Under this framework, companies must disclose not only how sustainability issues affect their financial performance, but also how their operations effect society and the environment. This dual lens distinguishes the EU’s approach from the U.S. and ISSB standards, which prioritize enterprise value. The EU’s emphasis on double materiality reflects its commitment to holistic sustainability reporting, requiring companies to assess and disclose biodiversity impacts, deforestation risks, and social equity initiatives alongside financial risks.
* **U.S. Proposals on Materiality**: The SEC’s proposed climate disclosure rules, which are currently subject to multiple challenges, focused narrowly on financial materiality, requiring companies to report on climate risks that are likely to affect their bottom line or investor decision-making. Unlike the EU’s broader approach, these requirements stop short of mandating disclosures about societal or environmental impacts unless they pose a direct financial risk. This divergence highlights the more cautious and financially focused ESG trajectory in the U.S.

### 4. Enhanced Focus on Social and Governance Pillars

While environmental concerns have historically dominated ESG priorities, 2024 saw heightened emphasis on the social and governance dimensions. However, this shift also brought new challenges, particularly in the U.S., where support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives has [given rise to risk of significant backlash](https://www.wsj.com/business/corporate-dei-policy-changes-pull-back-33fdab87?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202025-01-02%20ESG%20Dive%20%5Bissue:69108%5D&utm_term=ESG%20Dive).

* **Social Responsibility**: Companies faced growing pressure to demonstrate their commitment to DEI, with workforce diversity metrics, pay equity initiatives, and ethical labor practices becoming central components of ESG strategies. Many businesses also increased investments in community development, funding local education, healthcare, biodiversity protection, and infrastructure projects. However, in the U.S., [DEI programs faced pushback from political groups and legal challenges](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/bloomberglawnews/exp/eyJpZCI6IjAwMDAwMTkzLWQ1ZjUtZDQ5ZS1hOWI3LWRkZjViODQ3MDAwMSIsImN0eHQiOiJDVE5XIiwidXVpZCI6ImhxR1kyeEVvTGVQeGlldDlxUlhZVEE9PTRibFRRUno4VTdxR2l3Y1dBaHZsbVE9PSIsInRpbWUiOiIxNzM1ODE5OTkwNzkwIiwic2lnIjoiSFhOMm1KK0NiWFZIbm1WY2tSRVdRUDBRcWFJPSIsInYiOiIxIn0=?source=newsletter&item=body-link&region=text-section&channel=esg), with critics alleging reverse discrimination and questioning the legality of certain workplace practices. Most recently, in a 9-8 en banc ruling in *Alliance for Fair Board Recruitment v. Securities and Exchange Commission*, No. [21-60626-CV0](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/21/21-60626-CV0.pdf), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the SEC’s approval of Nasdaq’s board diversity rules. Some U.S. companies are pulling back from their prior DEI commitments, and some of the businesses that continue to support DEI initiatives are [changing how they talk about diversity](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/bloomberglawnews/bloomberg-law-news/X7VEGFJ8000000#jcite).
* **Governance Reforms**: Investors and stakeholders demanded greater accountability in corporate governance. Companies responded by enhancing board diversity, aligning executive compensation with ESG performance, and strengthening anti-corruption policies. Despite this progress, the political climate in the U.S. created challenges for companies trying to balance governance reforms with backlash against broader ESG priorities, including DEI.
* **Human Rights Due Diligence**: High-risk sectors like apparel and electronics saw expanded adoption of human rights due diligence frameworks to address risks such as forced labor and unsafe working conditions. These efforts were often driven by regulations like the EU’s supply chain due diligence directive, which required companies to take a more active role in ensuring ethical sourcing. In the U.S., human rights efforts were less centralized, as federal regulation and oversight is limited and state-level laws created inconsistent requirements for companies.
* **Stakeholder-Driven Leadership**: Executive decisions increasingly reflected stakeholder interests, with sustainability and equity objectives incorporated into strategic goals. Leadership accountability was emphasized through performance-linked compensation. However, navigating polarized stakeholder views on ESG – particularly in regions where DEI and governance reforms were contested – became a growing challenge for corporate leaders.

### 5. ESG-Related Litigation in 2024

Litigation became a defining feature of ESG developments in 2024, as stakeholders used legal avenues to address perceived failures in sustainability and governance. Key categories included:

* **Challenges to ESG Regulations**: In the U.S., the SEC’s climate disclosure rules became a flashpoint in the broader cultural and political battle over ESG. Lawsuits from business groups and Republican-led states accused the agency of regulatory overreach, framing ESG as an imposition on free-market principles. The proposed rule has been stayed pending decision on the consolidated cases by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit, and many believe it is [likely to be rescinded by the Trump administration](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/09/congress/paul-atkins-sec-climate-00193254). This pushback contrasted starkly with the EU, where similar measures have faced little resistance and are broadly accepted as necessary for global sustainability goals.
* Global Climate Litigation: Across the globe, governments, corporations, and financial institutions faced lawsuits for failing to meet climate commitments or exacerbating environmental harm. Island nations pursued international litigation against major emitters, claiming damages from rising sea levels. On Dec. 2, 2024, [landmark public hearings](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157671) on that case began in Hague before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on United Nations member states’ legal obligations under international law with respect to climate change.

On completion of the process, the ICJ will issue an advisory opinion, which will clarify U.N. states’ legal obligations under international law and the consequences for breaching them.

The U.S. has seen an increase in adversarial climate litigation. State and municipal governments filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, alleging decades of deception and demanding compensation for climate-related damages. Legal actions also targeted manufacturers of single-use plastics for environmental harm, pushing for accountability and cleanup costs.

* **DEI Litigation**: DEI programs in the U.S. faced legal scrutiny, with plaintiffs alleging reverse discrimination in hiring practices and workplace policies. These cases were fueled by U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in [*Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf), striking down affirmative action in college admissions. In response to these lawsuits and broader societal resistance, some companies scaled back or restructured their DEI programs to emphasize merit-based systems while avoiding explicit references to race or gender.
* **Greenwashing Allegations**: Companies faced a growing number of lawsuits for overstating sustainability achievements, such as carbon neutrality or ethical sourcing, without verifiable evidence. Disputes over fraudulent or unverified carbon credits and misleading product labels further highlighted weaknesses in verification systems.
* **Supply Chain Accountability**: Lawsuits targeted companies for human rights violations and environmental harm within their supply chains, particularly under laws like the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and EU supply chain due diligence directives, including the EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Law
* **ESG Enforcement Actions**: Federal agencies took a more active role in investigating and penalizing non-compliance with ESG regulations. The SEC initiated enforcement actions against companies for failures in climate risk disclosures and greenwashing, while the Department of Justice (DOJ) pursued cases related to environmental violations and human rights abuses in supply chains. [These actions continued after the SEC disbanded its SEC Task Force](https://natlawreview.com/article/sec-esg-and-climate-enforcement-gearing-winding-down-or-business-usual), underscoring the continuing regulatory focus on accountability and transparency in corporate ESG related disclosures.

### 6. Investor Activism and Stakeholder Engagement

Investor activism and stakeholder engagement remained powerful forces driving ESG priorities in 2024, fostering accountability and collaboration across industries. While both the EU and U.S. experienced significant engagement, their approaches often reflected broader regional differences in ESG adoption and priorities.

* **Shareholder Advocacy**: Institutional investors filed resolutions addressing climate action, DEI initiatives, and governance reforms. In the EU, shareholder campaigns frequently aligned with stringent regulatory frameworks, emphasizing biodiversity preservation, emissions reduction, and social equity. By contrast, in the U.S., shareholder proposals often faced greater resistance this past year.
* **Employee Engagement**: Employees across sectors became vocal advocates for ESG improvements, focusing on workplace equity, pay transparency, and sustainable business practices. In the EU, employee engagement often centered on aligning corporate practices with regional social welfare and sustainability goals, whereas U.S. employee advocacy frequently encountered political or legal resistance to ESG priorities.
* **Consumer Pressure**: Consumers on both sides of the Atlantic demanded more ethical and sustainable products, pushing businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprints, and continuing the growing trend in recent years toward greater transparency.
* **Cross-Sector Partnerships**: Collaboration among businesses, NGOs, and governments tackled systemic challenges like deforestation, forced labor, and industry decarbonization. The EU excelled in leveraging public-private partnerships to advance sustainability goals, often supported by strong regulatory incentives. In the U.S., funding and tax credits provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act provided substantial inducements for cross-sector efforts.
* **Biodiversity Activism**: In both regions, activist investors prioritized biodiversity conservation, pressuring companies in industries like agriculture, mining, and forestry to adopt stricter practices. EU biodiversity activism often aligned with regulatory requirements, such as deforestation-free supply chain mandates, whereas U.S. efforts were more market-driven, reflecting stakeholder and consumer expectations rather than regulatory mandates.

### 7. Challenges in ESG Implementation

Despite progress, implementing ESG principles remains a complex undertaking, with persistent challenges that hinder progress:

* **Data Gaps and Inconsistencies**: Collecting reliable and consistent data from global supply chains remains a significant challenge, particularly for small and medium-sized suppliers with limited resources. The emphasis on Scope 3 emissions in the EU and ISSB standards has further exposed these data collection gaps.
* **High Costs of Sustainability**: Transitioning to renewable energy, implementing traceability technologies, and meeting compliance standards often require substantial financial investment. The EU’s stringent double materiality requirements have increased compliance costs for multinational corporations, while U.S. firms face uncertainties due to fragmented regulatory landscapes.
* **Geopolitical Risks**: Geopolitical factors exacerbated the divergence between ESG approaches in the U.S. and EU. The EU, focused on building ESG resilience in supply chains, emphasized cross-border cooperation on issues such as deforestation and biodiversity. In the U.S., political tensions around ESG fostered uncertainty, as state and federal governments sent mixed signals to corporations regarding compliance expectations.
* **Greenwashing Risks**: In the EU, greenwashing risks prompted stricter regulatory oversight and enforcement to ensure credibility in ESG claims. The U.S. regulatory environment, marked by increased litigation and growing enforcement actions by agencies like the SEC, has created a challenging landscape for companies seeking to balance ambitious sustainability goals with compliance demands.
* **Measurement and Benchmarking Challenges**: The absence of globally harmonized metrics for key ESG indicators, including biodiversity impacts, deforestation rates, and Scope 3 emissions, complicates efforts

## Abstract

This research delves into the central position of digital technology as a stimulator of sustainable economic advancement. This study examines the complementary convergence of policy structures, law, and environmental economics that unleashes this advancement. This research finds and explores converging strategies in tapping digital innovation towards sustainability goals through benchmarking China, the EU, and the USA. This study bridges a gap in the literature since it undertakes a systematic, cross-disciplinary analysis and offers policymakers valuable inputs to craft effective strategies leveraging technology to a prosperous, sustainable world future. The results prove that new technologies enhance environmental law efficacy, transparency, and enforcement. It provides a prospective framework integrating digital solutions into policy and legal design, connecting economic growth with environmental degradation. Imperial methods in the form of qualitative research grounded on literature review, secondary data, green growth sustainable development, circular economy project studies, and smart conurbations to evaluate the efficacy of digital policy machinery indicate that digitally empowered policies significantly enhance resource productivity, maximise environmental taxation and cap-and-trade instruments, and enhance green innovation. This paper concludes with a policy road map for integrating digital to achieve synergistic economic and environmental objectives, calling for a new paradigm in environmental economic policy and law.

## 1. Introduction

The global demand for sustainable development necessitates a paradigm shift to a green and circular economy, equated with sophisticated socioeconomic and environmental trade-offs. Within sustainability transition and environmental economics, a key challenge still awaits a solution [1]. Digital technologies are emerging as key facilitators of sustainable economic progress in a technologically expanding economy. With the climate crisis, resource scarcity, and increasing inequality generating once-in-a-century world challenges, the importance of digital transformation for sustainable development has become ubiquitous. Where economics of development, environmental governance, and law intersect, digital technologies are reshaping the sustainability strategy of societies [2]. It is best to observe how different nations, led by China, the European Union (EU), and the United States, incorporate digital technologies into their long-term sustainable development agendas. By comparing these three great economic powers, we can observe the challenges of utilizing digital innovation for long-term economic and environmental well-being [3]. The technologies enable ecological rules to be enforced and monitored in real-time, improving compliance and transparency [4]. Satellite imagery and Internet of Things sensors allow governments to track air pollution, forest cover, and water quality, and blockchain technology is being studied to make supply chains more transparent and prevent environmental fraud. Legally, digital technologies are imposing novel thinking on sustainability. Within the EU, directives like the General Data Protection Regulation set an international benchmark for managing data, with repercussions for collecting and utilizing environmental data. Within China, state-led plans will typically include rigorous controls on digital means for monitoring the environment in line with the state’s top-down model. The USA possesses a more diverse legal system, with technology-oriented sustainability programs driven by a mix of federal and state efforts, resulting in multiple policy implementations across the country [5].

The European Union is the paragon of human digital policy leadership, exemplified by the AI Act and Digital Markets Act, which prioritizes human innovation through risk-based regulation [6,7]. In contrast, China has pursued a state-centric approach, where the creation of AI is heavily connected to national sustainability goals, using plans like the next-generation AI development plan. However, empirical research has yet to examine how the various strategies of the EU’s precautionary principle versus China’s state-capitalist model impact scalability and innovation ecosystems comparatively [8]. Alternatively, the United States only advocates for market-led innovation with regulation by sectors such as the NIST AI risk management framework [9], generating another unique paradigm whose sustainability implications in the long term have yet to be thoroughly investigated [10]. Research gaps in the existing literature have established the exceptional value of digital technologies, policy frameworks, and ecological economics in supporting development. However, a crucial scientific omission is the lack of cross-disciplinary examination that determines the interdependencies and conflicts between these three fields. How accurate are country and international policies in terms of data privacy law, carbon taxes, and e-commerce agreements? These are enabling or hindering the utilization of digital tools towards sustainability, and the legal and regulatory challenges that follow from the intersection of rapid technological progress and existing environmental law. A concise guide for policymakers is needed to examine the ecological economic impact of digitizing multiple industries’ power and manufacturing [11].

Green innovation, circular economy strategies, and digital transformation governance are complex, multi-level tasks requiring novel regulatory approaches that match the rapid pace of innovation with sustainability requirements. Contemporary literature identifies dominant paradigms, the EU model of rights-based precaution, China’s developmental state-capitalist pattern [12], and America’s governance by sectors. Incipient evidence shows that such models form diverging innovation trajectories with varying sustainability implications. The EU achieves more algorithmic accountability but postpones commercialization, and China has faster scaling. [Figure 1](#sustainability-17-08666-f001) illustrates the most critical design for robust digital transformation, drivers, and support pillars. Existing systems analysis indicates that polycentric governance networks and blockchain regulatory technologies hold promise in addressing these issues through decentralized compliance mechanisms, innovation ecosystems, and regional development.

**Figure 1.**
This model was created to illustrate how digital transformation is used in this study.

To what extent do current intellectual property laws and carbon pricing tools create competing incentives for investment in digital circular economy business models? How do current national digital and environmental policy systems interact to ease or impede the adoption of IoT technologies for sustainable waste management in the European Union and Southeast Asia context?

The regulation, legal, and economic contexts of China, the EU, and the USA shape how they embed digital technologies in sustainable economic growth. While China struggles with its central state and enormous technology expansion, it leverages digital technologies to promote economic productivity and secure ambitious environmental objectives. China is reducing its carbon emissions while building its digital economy through large-scale infrastructure investment and state-backed green technology [13].

Nevertheless, the EU has strongly focused on regulatory regimes to direct its digitalization towards sustainability. The best example is the European Green Deal, in which digital technologies are holistically targeted to achieve carbon neutrality through expanding renewable energy, circular economy customs, and sustainable farming. In addition, the EU places transparency and accountability at the forefront of its digital policies, setting a good example for other regions [14]. The USA is more market-oriented with private sector-driven innovation. Although there has been a significant federal push through efforts like the Clean Power Plan, clean tech and energy companies largely drive technological innovation towards sustainability. Unlike top-down regulation, digital transformation mainly occurs through decentralized and competitive processes [15].

Unresolved trade-offs between rapid technology adoption and regulative prudence in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and The Absence of scalable frameworks integrating digitalization’s legal, economic, and environmental aspects [17]. The transition to sustainable and moral economic leadership is among the most relevant social science issues of the 21st century. Because cross-cutting crises from climate change to information imbalances expose the shortcomings of mainstream growth paradigms, new paradigms should move hand-in-hand with environmental sustainability, social Fairness, and governance innovation [18]. The emergence of digitalization and AI-driven economies makes this adaptation challenging, requiring interdisciplinary systems to harmonize technological development with ethical and environmental safeguards. While guidance is provided through frameworks like the UNSDGs, policy alignment gaps, corporate accountability, and systemic resilience are still lacking in implementation [19]. This article delves into how social science theory, ranging from institutional economics to complexity science, can be utilized to create adaptive solutions for inclusive and future-proofed economic systems [20].

## 2. Literature Review

Integrating digital solutions into economic development is at the heart of promoting sustainability transitions and shaping environmental economics policy and law. Digital technologies such as analytics are key in optimizing resource use, reducing waste, and enhancing energy management, thereby facilitating ecological sustainability. These technologies also ease the transition to a circular economy and sustainable manufacturing and infrastructure design, which are critical for economic sustainability [21]. Moreover, the digital economy plays a significant role in helping achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by facilitating resource efficiency and environmental conservation. The environmental sustainability of digital technologies enables smart energy management and pollution monitoring towards sustainable production and urban planning. IoT sensors and systems are utilized to track environmental indicators, which assist in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving renewable energy sources. Economic sustainability of the digital economy enables the transformation to a circular and digital sharing economy, encouraging sustainable production and infrastructure planning. Industrial agglomeration, driven by the digital economy, significantly affects sustainable development with regional variations in efficacy [22]. This type of system prevents waste by producing products for recycling and reusing. It optimizes material efficiency, reduces resource extraction and pressure on the environment, and creates new economic opportunities.

### 2.1. Economics of Energy Transition and Decarbonization

The social sustainability of bridging the digital divide is essential to achieving social sustainability, which calls for comprehensive policy perspectives. To ensure a fair and sustainable future, the digital revolution must be brought within reach and even-handed. Legal and policy effects of the digitization of international economic law extend to corporate governance, trade law, and dispute resolution, and put in perspective the need for new legal paradigms of the digital economy [23]. Sustainable digitalization principles are necessary to align digital and green transitions, promote climate neutrality, and reduce carbon footprints. While digital solutions offer tremendous opportunities for sustainability transitions, data privacy concerns and weak governance, among others, can hamper the pace. Further, uneven integration of digital and sustainable development concepts in different areas of law calls for policy initiatives that would align these transitions holistically. International collaboration and training programs are required to effectively coordinate digital and green transitions towards a competitive and sustainable future.

It is aimed at facilitating the development of an equitable climate policy. It entails how benefits and risks are allocated to shield poor and marginalized individuals from being disproportionately hurt. This partition provides the foundation for systems thinking analysis of sustainable economic management in the digital age by embracing accessible knowledge and theory. The research synthesis offers a critical review of accessible studies in digital transformation. AI governance frameworks and EU, USA, and China regulatory frameworks are uniformly deployed to search for patterns and gaps in sustainable innovation, particularly where legal foundations are trailed by disruptive technology. The theoretical background places the analysis within systems thinking theory, the theory of regulation, sustainability frameworks, and UN SDGs [24], providing the conceptual tools to examine interactions between technology, law, and economics that are complicated. This two-way strategy produces rigorous, actionable outputs for innovation-sustainability trade-off governance. Synthesis creates a 12% research deficit in systemic risk research and explains why current frameworks lack the nonlinear impact of blockchain regulation and cascades of algorithmic governance. This research presents a new Systems Law Matrix by synthesizing these empirical and theoretical components. This new analytical instrument combines major system theory principles with Ashby’s and Weinberg’s laws. It provides a formalized policy to analyze behavior, forecast emergent behavior, and find leverage points in systems ranging from software design to socioeconomic systems for sustainable economic management, balancing innovation velocity and sustainability imperatives in digital technologies [25].

### 2.2. Circular Economy Reproductions and Material Efficiency

This quantifies nature’s economic value, such as clean water or pollination. It estimates the financial value of nature, clean water, or pollination. It strives to integrate such values into decisions to prevent environmental loss and depreciation, and the development of digital technologies such as AI, blockchain, and big data analytics has revolutionized economic governance patterns worldwide. Intellectual research constructs different trajectories of leading economies based on alternative regulatory brains and tech agendas [26]. China’s strategy focuses on state-led digitalization, integrating AI and surveillance technology to advance regulatory power and economic planning [27]. The state promotes fintech as a smart infrastructure with tight control over tech giants.

In contrast, the EU follows a rights-based policy, placing data privacy, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and ethical acts front and center to balance innovation with democratic protection. Blockchain is increasingly used in open public administration, particularly in cross-border transactions and digital identity platforms [28]. The U.S., by contrast, has a market-based system with private innovation in AI-based finance, algorithmic trading, and dominant decentralized blockchain applications with minimal federal intervention. Comparative studies identify China’s centralized governance, the EU’s strict regulatory regime, and the U.S.’s laissez-faire approach. Challenges include cybersecurity attacks, digital divides, and geopolitical competition for tech supremacy. Early evidence identifies web surveys’ role in measuring the economic impact of digital transformation. AI and automation are projected to reshape labor markets’ blockchain to boost bureaucratic efficiency but raise scaling challenges. All three regions share risks like algorithmic prejudice, cybersecurity attacks, and regulatory fragmentation [29].

### 2.3. Public Policy and Ecological Economics

Ecological economic public policy seeks to develop tools that balance economic growth and environmental sustainability. Market-based tools like green finance are among the top sectors that discourage pollution by channeling investments towards green projects and promoting green innovation. Environmental policy can stimulate techno-innovations and increase the efficiency of resource allocation, though they vary in performance across places and city size. Policy mix and consistency matter in promoting ecological innovation, but the evidence is nascent, particularly regarding the effects of stability and consistency. Additionally, economic instruments like environmental transfer payments attempt to outcompete the opportunity costs of conservation. Still, they could end up locally distorting incentives and inducing industrialization incompatible with environmental goals unless supplemented with high role incentives. Mechanisms of government responsibility are central to ensuring ecological public goods are adequately supplied, with demand for legal and institutional arrangements based on theories of sustainability [30]. This article uses the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) analytical framework in describing the evolution towards a circular digital economy. The MLP helps conceptualize interactions between niche innovations, modular phone design, socio-technical regimes, dominant tech manufacturing practices, landscape pressures, and climate change. The MLP is a theory being considered, which suggests that EU policies constitute landscape pressures aiming to subvert the existing ‘regime’ of linear production. China’s approach is to create state-backed ‘niches’ by scale. The U.S.’s lack of federal policy preserves the stability of today’s unsustainable regime [31].

Governments lead policy-led green growth. They invest in research, levy charges like carbon pricing, and de-risk private investment to accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy. It explains the shift from non-renewable fossil fuels to renewable energy. It balances the cost of green technology as an investment against the mega-economic cost of uncontrolled global warming. New research on digital transformation presents deep trade-offs between technology growth at high velocity and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Although emerging technologies like AI and blockchain create economic efficiency, the environmental implications of these technologies are inadequately articulated in existing governance systems, including knowledge gaps. Environmental Externality Energy-intensive digital infrastructure and the production of e-waste are most likely to cancel out climate commitments [32]. Social Equity Exclusionary growth; loss of employment and algorithmic injustice through automation and disenfranchisement; Issues and Governance Stiflingly rigidly structured regulatory infrastructure that cannot keep pace with innovation without requiring ESG. The latest IMF currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves (COFER) survey data shows that total foreign exchange reserves declined to USD 12.36 trillion in April 2024 from USD 12.75 trillion in March 2024, primarily because of the appreciation of reserve currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, as shown. The IMF statistics reveal that foreign exchange reserves worldwide amount to trillions of dollars, supporting internal currencies and facilitating international payments, as illustrated in [Figure 2](#sustainability-17-08666-f002).

### 2.4. National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Circular Economy

This quantifies the economic worth of nature, say, clean water or pollination. It attempts to turn such values into decision-making to prevent environmental loss and degradation. The greatest weakness is the absence of consistent metrics to consider the technology’s ESG footprint. Follow-up research targets the development of dynamic governance models that combine innovation and sustainability requirements, particularly learning from circular economy thinking and ethics-based artificial intelligence systems [33]. Recent works refer to opposing regulatory structures on digital transformation across the top economies. The European Union’s AI Act 2024 implements a risk-based classification regime, prohibiting specific high-risk uses but mandating transparency measures for generative AI. China’s Digital Silk Road vision integrates tech infrastructure exports with data governance norms, promoting substitute digital settings while sparking concerns about surveillance exports [34]. The United States employs a sectoral model, agency-specific rules, FTC regulation of AI bias, and voluntary guidelines like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, prioritizing innovation over control. Such an approach reveals tensions between enabling innovation and risk management, which have implications for global digital standard-setting [35].

These implications include how legal norms emerge from feedback loops between institutions, relations of power, and cultural values that scholars celebrate. Digital governance was recently mapped out as an illustration, where algorithmic regulation and societal reaction dynamically co-evolve

With economic indicators such as inflation and job markets continuing to stabilize in 2024, shopper confidence is improving, although still at historically low levels. This improvement shows regional variation, with consumers in China and USA showing only small gains, compared to the average across all OECD countries.

Middle East & Africa saw strong growth, but with different trends within this region. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and United Arab Emirates (UAE) are delivering strong performance due to positive consumer mood. This contrasts with Türkiye, where high inflation and weakened local currency are driving consumers to convert their cash into goods.
Latin America and Eastern Europe stayed relatively stable, but Developed Asia, Emerging Asia and China were hit by significant falls in 2023 sales revenue.
02 7 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Consumer Tech & Durables – 2023 dynamics There’s a similar variation in performance across sectors. ▪ Globally, only Photo delivered strong revenue growth last year, driven by consumers’ renewed focus on travel and out-of-home activities. ▪ Small Domestic Appliances (SDA) just tipped the scale at +1.2% growth – a faster return to positive figures compared to some sectors, due to comparatively higher product innovation and lower price point. ▪ Telecom was very nearly stable, helped by relatively short replacement cycles on products such as smartphones, as well as more 5G models being sold. ▪ In MDA, sales were focused on energy efficient models, driven by rising electricity bills and Europe’s mandatory labelling for energy efficiency. ▪ Products within Office, Information Tech (IT) and Consumer Electronics (TV/audio) suffered the greatest drop in sales revenue compared to 2022. However, compared to the pre-pandemic benchmark, IT sector revenue is higher now, whereas consumer electronic sector revenue is not – indicating a shift in sector structure within the Tech & Durables market.

This is a good improvement on the -2.9% seen last year, but still a highly challenging landscape in which brands will be competing hard for a share of growth. GfK anticipates that demand will be highest in the telecom and small domestic appliance sectors. Products bought during lockdowns that have relatively short replacement cycles, such as smartphones, will now be coming ready for replacing - boosting opportunities for brands. Additionally, small-ticket products that exert less pressure on consumers’ budgets, such as IT accessories, are also likely to be popular. 03 11 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 28% Jan 2024, from 26% in Jan 2023 “I am better oﬀ ﬁnancially now than a year ago” 34% Jan 2024, from 39% in Jan 2023 “I am worse oﬀ ﬁnancially now than a year ago” 11 This year sees consumer sentiment slowly improving, although still weighted towards caution: Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 In general, we expect shoppers to lean toward well-thought-out purchases, due to a continued focus on the heightened cost of living. Aspirational purchases are still on the cards, given that 39% of people say it is important to indulge or pamper themselves on a regular basis. However, these will be the result of consumers carefully weighing the value that they expect to receive against the level of spend. For manufacturers and retailers, it is critical to understand the multiple factors that their target audiences see as being most important to them as an individual, based on their specific needs, ideals, lifestyle, and situation. Equally critical is accurately to assess the price point at which the offer tips from being worth the money in the eyes of each target group, to being out of reach.
Source: NIQ Consumer Outlook January 2024 12 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Where the opportunities lie Where the opportunities lie 04 2024 is all about producing the best value for consumers at the right price, as manufacturers and retailers compete harder than ever to win the battle for mental and physical availability. With money-conscious consumers continuing to shop around and weigh up every purchase, it can be tempting for brands to discount prices to drive volume of sales. We saw this last year, with the top seven annual promotional events* including brand events increasing in duration to cover 15 weeks of the year – up from 11 weeks in 2019 (*Christmas, New Year, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, 618 and Double-11, Apple event, Prime Days). However, competing on price eats into margins and risks getting sucked into price races. 13 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Where the opportunities lie An alternative is focusing on innovation to help stand out from your competitors. By adapting products or services to fit the needs of specific customer segments, companies can diversify their revenue streams and fuel growth.
Innovation does not have to be about radical or big changes. It is often the incremental progress that steadily adds features, convenience, and performance in pace with consumers’ changing lifestyles that is more important. Indeed, history shows that brands that continually invest in innovation perform better over the course of market downturns. As we head into a stabilizing landscape, we see incremental innovation that pinpoints specific audiences’ needs as a key factor in uncovering new pockets of demand. ""With ongoing high levels of economic caution, consumers have a very clear idea of what they want from the brands they interact with. If they are not replacing or upgrading existing products, then consumers are on the lookout for products that help them lead happier and healthier lives. Brands need to maintain a laser-focus on precisely how their products can align with those aims.""

Consumer confidence is still fragile, but there are target groups that are buying higher-end items when these present greater relevance and value, in return for the extra money spent.
Last year, premium brands took 3 in every 10 dollars that consumers spent on tech and durables. They also maintained their year-on-year sales revenue, performing far better in this respect than entry-level brands and marginally better than standard brands. A key element in this is the role played by brand strength. Strong brands typically enjoy higher levels of consumer trust and loyalty. This can play in their favor when consumers are weighing the benefit versus risk of buying a higher-priced item. 42% I only buy products or services from a trusted brand Source: GfK Consumer Life 2023 53% For me the most important thing is that it oﬀers good value for money Source: GfK Consumer Life 2023 15 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 15 Where the opportunities lie Diverse dynamics visible in price bands across sectors However, the importance that consumers place on brand changes depending on the product in question. To successfully persuade consumers towards products that offer greater value, but at a higher price, it is critical to tailor the marketing communication correctly between brand image and product value offering.
In telecoms, consumer electronics (including photo), and SDA, premium brands hold a significant share of sales and were more resilient in maintaining their sales revenue last year than entry level brands. In these sectors, consumers continue to prefer brands with flagship products that generate trust in quality and performance – and are willing to pay more for that. By contrast, MDA stands out as the sector that saw premium brands perform much worse than entry level or standard brands last year. Consumers are less emotionally attached to products such as washing machine or dishwasher, compared to a smartphone. When buying an appliance, their focus is more on functions such as energy efficiency and performance – and this makes it more likely that they will consider lower- or non-premium brands that offer similar feature sets. Other effects play a role as well. For example, lower income groups are starting to come back to the markets having postponed non-essential purchases during recent difficult years. These groups are likely to choose entry level or standard brands that offer sufficient feature sets at a lower price.

In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, electronic devices like mobile phones and tablets have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, the fast-paced evolution of these gadgets results in a growing electronic waste (e-waste) problem. To combat this issue and promote sustainability, many organizations have embraced the principles of the circular economy by implementing successful recycling programs for mobiles and tablets. In this article, we will explore several case studies of organizations that have effectively implemented such programs, highlighting their strategies, impacts, and lessons learned.

* **Apple's Recycling Initiatives**

Apple, a leading technology company, has been at the forefront of sustainability efforts in the tech industry. The company introduced the Apple Renew program, allowing customers to return their old devices for recycling. Apple's recycling robot, Daisy, disassembles iPhones and recovers valuable materials like aluminum, cobalt, and gold, which can be reused in new devices. This approach not only reduces e-waste but also minimizes the need for mining raw materials, making it an exemplary circular economy model.

Apple's recycling initiatives have significantly contributed to reducing their carbon footprint and conserving natural resources. By incorporating recycled materials into their products, they have set an example for the industry, demonstrating that sustainable practices can be economically viable.

* **Samsung's ""Galaxy Upcycling"" Program**

Samsung, another tech giant, has embarked on its circular economy journey through its ""Galaxy Upcycling"" program. The initiative aims to extend the lifespan of older Galaxy smartphones by repurposing them for various applications. For instance, these devices can be transformed into home automation controllers, baby monitors, or even CCTV cameras. By breathing new life into older devices, Samsung not only reduces e-waste but also offers affordable, sustainable solutions to consumers.

The ""Galaxy Upcycling"" program has showcased Samsung's commitment to environmental responsibility while fostering innovation in the tech industry. This approach aligns with the circular economy's core principles of reuse and prolonging product life cycles.

* **Fairphone's Ethical and Modular Design**

Fairphone, a Dutch company, has taken a different approach to promote sustainability in the mobile industry. They have developed the Fairphone, a modular smartphone designed for easy repair and upgradeability. Fairphone's commitment to ethical sourcing of materials and fair labor practices is also noteworthy. The modular design of their devices allows users to replace individual components, such as the camera or battery, rather than discarding the entire device.

Fairphone's circular approach to smartphone design addresses not only e-waste but also social and environmental issues associated with the production of electronic devices. Their commitment to transparency and sustainability serves as an inspiring model for the entire industry.

**Closing the Loop with EPEAT**

The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) is a global registry that certifies electronic products based on their environmental performance. EPEAT's rating system considers factors such as energy efficiency, recyclability, and the use of hazardous materials. Companies like Dell, HP, and Lenovo have embraced EPEAT certification for their tablets and laptops, aligning their products with circular economy principles.

By adhering to EPEAT standards, these companies have made significant strides in reducing their environmental impact and promoting responsible consumption. They have also gained a competitive advantage by appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.

**The Role of NGOs and Governments**

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments also play a crucial role in promoting the circular economy in the mobile and tablet industry. For example, the European Union's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive mandates the responsible disposal and [recycling of electronic devices](https://www.oceantech.com/itad/). It encourages manufacturers to take responsibility for the end-of-life management of their products, fostering a circular economy approach.

NGOs like the Basel Action Network (BAN) work to combat e-waste by exposing illegal export practices and promoting responsible recycling. BAN's e-Stewards program certifies recyclers who adhere to strict environmental and ethical standards.

**Conclusion**

The case studies presented here demonstrate that the circular economy is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible and effective approach to addressing the growing problem of e-waste in the mobile and tablet industry. Organizations like Apple, Samsung, Fairphone, and others are leading the way by implementing innovative strategies that prioritize sustainability, resource conservation, and responsible consumption.

As the demand for electronic devices continues to rise, it is imperative that more companies and governments adopt similar circular economy principles to reduce the environmental and social impact of e-waste. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable future for generations to come, where electronic gadgets not only enrich our lives but also contribute to a healthier planet.

2023 Environmental Progress Report  2Reflections 

Apple is on a journey to  2030. 

In 2020, we reached carbon neutral for our corporate operations, but 

we always knew we could do more. So we set an even more ambitious 

goal  — to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire 

supply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers’ devices. 

Teams across Apple quickly got to work, and thanks to their innovations, 

we’ve made  extraordinary  progress. 

In this year’s report, you’ll find the most detailed portrait yet of where we 

are today and where we’re headed. Here’s the big picture: Since 2015, 

we’ve reduced our emissions by over  45 percent . We did it while reaching 

more Apple users than ever before. And, in doing so, we demonstrated 

that the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a 

false  one. 

This was also the year we called on our suppliers to accelerate their 

work to address their emissions. We’ve sent a clear message that the 

companies who manufacture our products must decarbonize their entire 

Apple footprint by 2030, including the use of  100 percent  renewable 

electricity. And today, over 250 of our suppliers  — accounting for over 

85 percent  of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend  — are a part of our 

Supplier Clean  Energy  Program. 

We share our progress  — and our goals  — because transparency and 

accountability are two sides of the same coin. We do the work and we 

show our work, because we want to be the ripple in the pond that creates 

a broader  change. 

This year, we’ve also made it easier to understand the carbon impact of 

your Apple devices, and the extraordinary steps we’re taking to reduce 

their emissions. In our Product Environment Reports, you can learn about 

recycled gold in your iPhone, the energy demands of your iPad, and the 

packaging around your Mac. We’re transforming so many aspects of the 

way we make our technology, and with our Product Environment Reports, 

you’ll see where we’ve made progress and where the hard  work  remains. 

One thing is clear: We’re closer than ever to the day you can hold your 

Apple device and be confident in the knowledge that it has net-zero 

carbon impact. There are few companies that can make that claim  — let 

alone ones that set our high standards and transparently show their 

progress along  the  way. 

As we move closer to our goals, we’ve continued to push the pace by 

bringing new clean energy online to power our supply chain. And we’re 

investing in a growing number of renewable energy projects to balance 

the electricity our customers use to charge  their  devices. 

Recycled materials are also a key focus of our innovations, and another 

way we’re driving down our emissions. Today, about  20 percent  of the 

materials in our products are from recycled or renewable sources. Our 

goal is to one day reach  100 percent , and to end our reliance on mining 

altogether. Where we continue to extract materials, we maintain the 

highest standards in our due diligence and respect for human rights. And 

we’re accelerating our work with new goals to use  100 percent  recycled 

cobalt, tin, gold, and rare earth elements in key components by 2025. 

The strides we’re making play a huge role in driving down our emissions 

even further, reducing our reliance on energy-intensive mining, smelting, 

and  refining. 

We’ll keep pursuing creative ways to reduce our footprint, and only use 

high-quality carbon offsets to balance emissions we can’t zero out. That’s 

why we launched the Restore Fund, which aims to help businesses invest 

in high-quality, nature-based solutions that restore the forests, wetlands, 

and grasslands that remove carbon from  our  atmosphere. 

Equity remains a central focus of our investments in clean energy and 

green technology. We continue to grow our Impact Accelerator, which 

invests in the next generation of innovative, diverse entrepreneurs in fields 

like clean energy, recycling, and green chemistry. We’ve also expanded 

our Power for Impact program, which brings renewable projects to 

communities around the world  — from neighborhoods in rural South 

Africa to underresourced schools in the Philippines. We believe the best 

way to fight climate change is to engage communities on their front lines, 

and every day, we put the action to  those  words. 

I’ve worn a few different hats over my career  — including as Administrator 

of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and leading this work at 

Apple. It’s taught me that tackling climate change is possible only when 

we bring government, industry, and communities together. We have to 

meet a global challenge with global solutions  — solutions that center 

on  people. 

I have so many talented, passionate colleagues who share in this mission. 

Thanks to their tireless work, we’ve hurdled barriers that once seemed 

impossible to clear. We have no illusions about the challenges ahead, but 

whatever comes, we’ll keep  marching  forward. 

Apple is on a journey  — and we’ll share the road with as many people as 

we can. We hope you’ll  join  us.

# highlights  Carbon neutral for 

corporate  emissions 

Since April 2020, we’ve achieved 

carbon neutrality for our 

corporate emissions 1 by sourcing 

100 percent  renewable electricity 

for Apple facilities, implementing 

energy efficiency, and securing 

high-quality carbon offsets for 

remaining emissions. While 

corporate emissions represent 

only a small portion of our overall 

emissions, this is an important 

step toward our broader goal of 

achieving carbon neutrality for all 

our  products.

# Circular Economic Principles—A Pathway to Sustainable Electronics

by Bill Olson / March 28, 2024

The concept of a circular economy has emerged as a critical pathway toward sustainable innovation and growth. This article explores the principles and applications of the circular economy. It highlights the circular economy's relevance in addressing environmental challenges—such as polluted water, plastic-filled oceans, and growing carbon emissions—and its extension to product lifecycle management.

### Defining the Circular Economy—Drawing Inspiration from Nature [...] We can learn a lot by studying nature and natural systems. With natural ecosystems, the raw materials of life are used and reused efficiently over millennia, combined in new ways and new life forms. In other words, nothing that is part of a living system goes to waste. Much like the cycle of nature, every exhaled molecule is conserved, recycled, and repurposed as technical nutrients to benefit future plants, animals, and ecosystems.

Much like the cycle of nature, every exhaled molecule is conserved, recycled, and repurposed as technical nutrients to benefit future plants, animals, and ecosystems.

The circular economy is designed to minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency by keeping materials and products in use for as long as possible. It aims to emulate the cyclical processes in nature to ensure nothing goes to waste, and everything is reused, recycled, or regenerated. By transitioning from a linear ""take-make-dispose"" model to a circular one, we can reduce our [total environmental impact](/setting-the-benchmark/what-is-total-environmental-impact) (TEI), conserve resources, and create a more sustainable future.

### Benefits of Reuse and Repair Strategies

Typically, at the end of its first working life, consumer electronic products are shredded, with only a few materials recovered and recycled. The economic value of a shredded product is minimal, and for products with sensitive data, the destruction process can cost more than the raw materials are worth. However, in a circular economy, we view the product as a resource and seek to maximize its value by either reusing the product or recovering and reusing the highly engineered state-of-the-art components that make up the product design. By doing so, we extend the product's working life, reduce waste, and conserve resources.

An effective strategy for reusing and repairing products is critical to foster a circular economy and meet sustainability goals. To that end, Benchmark recognizes the significance of sustainable materials sourcing and usage. Our aim is to optimize the flow of circular materials throughout the value chain to minimize waste. These reuse and repair solutions can also provide added benefits, including:

* Increased cost savings
* Higher rate of reuse
* Opportunities for growth and learning
* Identification of [Environmental, Social, and Governance](/setting-the-benchmark/reducing-your-industrial-carbon-footprint) (ESG) targets
* Reduction in packaging through increased reuse

However, there are challenges in implementing such a program. For example, there's often a lack of alignment on prioritizing reuse and repair that can lead to fragmented accountability and supplier repair backlogs. Local repair capabilities may also be underutilized. Nonetheless, substantial benefits can be realized by prioritizing circular economic principles in the reverse supply chain. Consider zero waste of materials, net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, increased use of reconditioned parts, improved global parts availability, and reduced cycle times, inventories, and costs related to reuse and repair materials.

Raw Content: LEMONSOUP14/SHUTTERSTOCK Reuters Events Sustainable Business Towards a circular economy for industrial electronics The design challenge June 2023 Sponsored by Towards a circular economy for industrial electronics June 2023 Reuters Events 2 INTRODUCTION Mountains of waste, decline in biodiversity and scarcity of resources: there are many good reasons for a circular economy. But how do you get there? This white paper shows why it makes sense to start with product design. Using Siemens as an example, it explains which aspects have the greatest impact, where the challenges lie, and why digitalization will boost the circular economy.
THE PROBLEM: WE ONLY HAVE ONE PLANET Pollution, ecosystem collapse, declining biodiversity, climate change: there is no doubt that our planet is in a dire state, and the way our economy has thus far functioned is partly to blame. In a linear economy, which has hitherto been the prevailing model, a pattern of extraction, production and disposal of finite resources has dominated – and still does. By 2050, it is projected that the world will need three Earth’s worth of natural resources to satisfy demand. Rates of consumption of biomass, fossil fuels, minerals and (metal) ores, for instance, are expected to double in the next 40 years, and waste generation could increase by 70%. Moreover, resource extraction and processing accounts for half of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and more than 90% of biodiversity loss and water stress. According to the UN, humans have transformed more than 70% of the Earth’s land area from its natural state, causing significant environmental degradation with far-reaching socio-economic effects.
ALKIS KONSTANTINIDIS/REUTERS A SOLUTION: THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY Based on the realization that “business as usual” will inevitably lead to a planetary disaster, a counter-model has developed: The concept of the circular economy. In contrast to the “take, make, waste” of the linear economy, the goal of a circular economy is to use resources for as long as possible, avoid waste and pollution, and regenerate natural systems. This concept can only succeed if economic activity and resource consumption are decoupled, i.e. material cycles are created that are ideally infinite or nearly infinite.
In order to implement the concept of circularity, a fundamental restructuring of the economic system is essential. “Designing products that meet the demands of a circular economy requires a completely new way of thinking”, says Caroline Cassignol, a materials scientist who works in Research and Development for Siemens. “This is challenging, but a unique opportunity to re-think products, processes and services to create a more sustainable future.” By 2050, it is projected that the world will need three Earth’s worth of natural resources to satisfy demand Towards a circular economy for industrial electronics June 2023 Reuters Events 3 Today, the economy is still far from circularity. However, more and more companies are looking into creating products that are long-lasting, upgradable, and repairable, reusable, recyclable or compostable. They are trying to find ways to incorporate secondary materials into production and powering such production with renewable energy. Where services are concerned, business models centered around subscription, sharing and leasing are prioritized. The intention behind this is to minimize the number of products required, e.g. cars in car-sharing, and keep them in use for as long as possible.
FROM OBLIGATION TO OPPORTUNITY: WHY CIRCULARITY IS THE NEW BUSINESS IMPERATIVE Realising a true circular economy won’t just take the pressure off overstretched natural resources, it also presents a unique market opportunity – one worth $4.5 trillion, according to Accenture. Businesses, therefore, have the chance not only to be planetary stewards, but market leaders.
There are myriad reasons for companies across sectors to move towards circularity: •  Resource scarcity and supply chain problems are driving up prices for raw materials. A shortfall of copper is projected, for example. The metal is commonly used in electronics and in products such as circuit boards and electrical equipment. By 2026, average copper prices are expected to reach $9,750/tonne, exceeding the $9,317/ tonne annual average of 2021. It is thus a competitive advantage to innovate around substitution, take-back systems, higher rates of recycling and more efficient use of the metal. •  Customers are increasingly looking for sustainable products and are more open to new business models such as products-as-a-service. •  On the investor side, more emphasis is being placed on sustainability. In interviews conducted by the Harvard Business Review, ESG (environmental, social and governance criteria) was “almost universally top of mind” for the 70 senior executives from 43 global institutional investing firms they spoke to. •  Other outside pressures are also growing. The regulatory environment, for instance: in 2015 the EU introduced the Circular Economy Action Plan, a comprehensive body of 54 legislative and non-legislative actions that were adopted or implemented by 2019. It was updated in 2020 and aims to make sustainable products the norm in the EU. It also focuses on sectors where the potential for circularity is high, such as electronics and information and communication technology (ICT), plastics, and construction and buildings. For companies that operate in industrial sectors – manufacturing, automation, building and energy services, and the like – the processes to determine how to most efficiently and effectively implement circularity may be particularly complex, but this does not mean that these industries are being left behind. One 2021 study published by the Journal of Environmental Management found that the utilities, consumer goods and industrial sectors are in fact leading the circular transformation. Firms in these industries, as well as those that make basic materials, “have the potential to play a critical role in the development of the CE because many of the technological developments that could accelerate circularity are within their sphere of operations,” the authors state. With outside pressures mounting, including from NGOs and civil society, the direction of travel is clear. “There's a big shift coming from the market itself, which is also driven by investors and regulations,” says Marlon Hassel, Sustainability Manager at Siemens Smart Infrastructure.
Rather than simply responding to outside pressures, however, forward-thinking businesses recognize that a competitive advantage lies in investing in sustainability and circular strategies. A study by Accenture demonstrated that companies that focus not only on innovation but also on sustainability and trust, outperform their industry peers, with 3.1% higher operating profits and greater returns to shareholders. DESIGN: THE KEY TO MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS In theory, the concept of a circular economy sounds plausible, but how can it be implemented? Of particular importance in creating a foundation of circularity, is design. It has been estimated that 80% of a product’s environmental impact can be influenced at the design phase. While this B. RENTSENDOR/REUTERS Towards a circular economy for industrial electronics June 2023 Reuters Events 4 figure may vary across product type, decisions made by designers with regards to material type, variety and volume, as well as their ability to be disassembled, refurbished, or recycled, among other factors, are critical. Indeed, eco-design that is informed by careful lifecycle analysis – where impacts are evaluated in relation to a wealth of of input and output parameters – is a key lever in integrating circularity.
While designing for circularity is always going to be a complex process, within electronics industries, it is particularly multi-faceted. A smartphone, for example, contains around 60 different materials, including around 30 different metals and various types of plastic. The task of separating out these materials alone is a major challenge; while the metals could in principle be reused, this is not always possible for plastics. Furthermore, a 2022 report by McKinsey found that as products become more sustainable, production usually accounts for proportionately more of their emissions. This is partly due to an increased demand from users for enhanced features and capabilities as well as more energy efficiency – such integrations tend to require more materials to produce. Domestic heat pumps, for example, require more materials than gas or oil boilers. The highly efficient electric motors they contain may be made from more carbon-heavy materials such as copper and rare earth magnets. “The variable-frequency drives that are used to optimize the control of these advanced motors need their own circuitry and semiconductor components,” states the report. Eco-design thus necessitates a full lifecycle analysis, from production to the use phase, so that circularity isn’t cancelled out by competing sustainability priorities. CREATING SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AT SIEMENS THROUGH ROBUST ECO DESIGN So how does a technology company like Siemens, which offers hundreds of thousands of different hardware products, go about realising this circular vision? “The basic prerequisite is that you have clear objectives that set the direction in which you want to improve your products,” says Marlon Hassel. Siemens has defined guiding principles for product design as part of its comprehensive sustainability strategy, the so called DEGREE framework. By 2030, the company wants to apply Robust Eco Design (RED) to all relevant product families. “With RED, we have created a system by which we can improve our products in all areas of sustainability,” says Hassel. Siemens RED principles were developed based on the international ISO standard IEC 62430 (Environmentally Conscious Design for Electrical and Electronic Products), as well as the company’s own internal design principles. “The goal is to empower product managers to understand and improve their products’ environmental footprints in the most appropriate way to their target application and market context,” says Marlon Hassel, who has a background in product portfolio management. “There is no one-size-fits-all-solution,” he adds.
At the heart of RED are life cycle assessments (LCAs), which measure a variety of impact indicators (Figure 2) based on product and operational data. LCAs ensure that every ecodesign measure is based on facts. However, because it can still be complicated for product managers to understand the direct link between their design decision and the product's environmental impact, Siemens has selected three leading indicators – climate change, resource use RED principles and strategic action fields for product optimization at Siemens.
Figure 1 Minimize impact on climate change Climate Neutrality Global warming potential Circular Economy Resource depletion Zero pollution Substances of concern Minimize impact on resource depletion Minimize impact on human health and biodiversity Minimize negative environmental impacts of products and associated processes ROBUST ECO DESIGN Towards a circular economy for industrial electronics June 2023 Reuters Events 5 and ecotoxicity – from which specific design strategies have been derived (Figure 1). “It is important to understand that improving the environmental impact of a product requires reducing input factors such as resources and energy, as well as output factors such as waste, emissions, or wastewater,” says Hassel. While carbon neutrality is mainly the result of efficient, flexible and clean energy consumption and lower emissions, the circular economy has a significant impact on climate change and resource depletion, both by reducing the need to extract and process new materials and by reducing the amount of waste. However, it is important to note that the elimination of harmful substances is a prerequisite for dismantling and therefore an important factor in the circular economy.
Already in the first year after the introduction of RED, 26% of the relevant Siemens product families were analyzed using this approach and teams are busy at work identifying and analyzing ways that it can be systematically, efficiently and cost-effectively applied across the company by 2030.

In addition to the transformation to more sustainability, a product must also be attractive in terms of performance and cost. Consequently, there are conflicting goals that need to be resolved. Conflicts can occur, for example, between •  different environmental aspects, e.g., better recyclability can lead to more CO2 emissions (e.g. if thermosets are replaced by thermoplastics). •  different lifecycle stages of products, systems, solutions or services with respect to an environmental aspect. For example, a better carbon footprint in the use phase may come at the cost of a worse carbon footprint in manufacturing. •  environmental and economic benefits, e.g. when a product is manufactured in a more environmentally compatible way to extend its lifetime. This results in an environmental benefit because fewer resources are consumed and less waste is generated in the long term, but at the same time the acquisition cost may increase significantly. •  environmental, technical, and/or quality considerations. For example, design decisions can have a negative impact on the reliability and durability of a product, even if this generates environmental benefits.
These conflicting goals illustrate which challenges have to be tackled in order to design a product sustainably in a comprehensive way. ROBUST ECO DESIGN IN ACTION A central aspect in the reduction of environmental impact is, of course, the greenhouse gas emissions that a product causes. The example of electrical switchgear shows how changes in product design can massively reduce the ecological footprint. Electrical switchgear is necessary in the transport of electricity. It is composed of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switchgear is used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done and to clear faults downstream. For a long time, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was used as an insulating gas in these products, as SF6 has dielectric properties, which means it is difficult for electric current to flow through it. The global warming potential of SF6, however, is hugely significant: more than 22,000 times that of CO2. Siemens has developed switchgear that uses ‘natural components of ambient air’ instead of SF6 – its ‘blue GIS’ range. This clean alternative has a global warming potential of less than one and can be released into the atmosphere once the switchgear reaches end of life. “The use of blue GIS significantly reduces the environmental footprint of the product,” says Thomas Dürr, standards and regulations manager at Siemens. With the absence of greenhouse gases that need to be contained and responsibly stored, dismantling and eventual recycling of the switchgear at end of life is also made more seamless. Although the reduction of greenhouse gases was the main focus in the development of the blue GIS portfolio, the absence of SF6 also has a positive effect on the circularity of the product by simplifying recycling.
Another area where RED principles are being applied is in the OpenAir damper actuator portfolio. Damper actuators are small motor-controlled devices that help to regulate and stop airflow and can commonly be found inside ducts or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, and systems. In terms of energy efficiency, actuators have always played a key role – they can be controlled so that air conditioning, for example, is not on in an empty room or at night, with resultant energy savings in the range of 20%-60%, says Emmanuelle Billard, director of sustainability for Building Products at Siemens. This energy saving potential was therefore a key point of consideration when analyzing which field of action to concentrate on. “In the lifecycle impact assessment, we identified that the most impact was in the use phase,” she says. “After a product is installed, it will often run for 20 years or longer. During those 20 years, it will be consuming energy, so we immediately saw that we need to focus on this use phase – on power consumption.” In this way, the optimized OpenAir damper actuator portfolio will contribute to more sustainable building operation, and thus also has an indirect impact on the consumption of resources.
Towards a circular economy for industrial electronics June 2023 Reuters Events 7 CHRISTIAN HARTMANN/REUTERS Figure 3: Which criteria have the biggest impact on product sustainability? This question is guiding Siemens in optimizing its products.
Figure 3 High Sustainability Potential Low THE JOURNEY TOWARDS CIRCULARITY The OpenAir damper actuator portfolio and blue GIS examples show that product design is highly relevant to reducing a product's carbon footprint. However, this does not yet meet the requirements of a circular economy. “Circularity requires a symbiosis between product design, operations and innovative business models,” emphasizes René Bauer, Electrical Products portfolio manager at Siemens. “Our goal is to keep products, components, and materials in the highest value loop according to the circularity hierarchy. This requires a comprehensive shift in how we are doing business today,” he adds. The more complex the product, the more challenging it is to implement circularity. Siemens is guided by a circularity hierarchy, which shows which criteria have the greatest impact on a product’s environmental impact.
1 PRODUCT LIFETIME EXTENSION The production of new materials and products always causes a greater environmental impact than the continued use of an existing product. Therefore, the highest sustainability potential is realized through high quality, reliable, maintainable, upgradeable and updatable products.
From a hardware perspective, modular design makes it easier to replace parts and conduct repairs, thereby extending product lifetimes. Siemens has applied this modular approach in the development of the new 3WA Air Circuit Breaker. In the new 3WA model, the application processor and the protective processor have been separated Zero waste hierarchy 1 Quality and maintainance Lifetime (Extension) Product Cycles Material Cycles 2 Upgrades and repair 4 Reuse and refurbish 4 Remanufacture 5 Recycle 6 Energy recovery Towards a circular economy for industrial electronics June 2023 Reuters Events 8 to improve the product’s upgradability. “The new circuit breaker shows that even proven, high-quality products can be further optimized in terms of their service life,” says Hassel.

Raw Content: Circular Economy Principles The circular economy is a systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. It is based on three principles driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials at their highest value, and regenerate nature.i At Dell Technologies, we are committed to accelerating the circular economy. As the world struggles to address the climate crisis and confront resource scarcity, population growth and unsustainable lifestyles, the circular economy offers solutions which can help solve for these issues. At Dell, we are continuing to accelerate the shift away from linear thinking and move to an even more circular model, focusing on how we can: • Design out waste and obsolescence • Embrace renewable sources of energy and materials • Offer new ways for customers to drive their own circular evolution • Partner broadly to accelerate this transition across the economy Dell has been adopting circular practices for over two decades.

Significance Society’s current, mostly linear approach to the global economy has been in place since the Industrial Revolution began. While material use is critical for continued global prosperity, the way materials are produced and consumed is increasingly unsustainable and has become an issue of global importance. • The world currently consumes 100 billion tons of materials every year. Meanwhile, humanity uses a year’s worth of ecological resources every 8 months – putting pressure on dwindling reserves.ii • The population has grown from approximately 1 billion people in 1800, to 2 billion by the 1920s, to nearly 7.8 billion today. Estimates show we could reach 9.9 billion by 2050.iii • Global temperatures have already risen by 1°C since the 1880s. Two-thirds of that warming has occurred since 1975.iv All of this is not just tied to energy, but everything that goes into human existence. With shifting demographics increasing the demand for goods and services, we need to find ways to satisfy global needs and wants while reducing resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Circularity offers an alternative, but today the world is falling short: global circularity (a measure of the share of “cycled” materials as part of the total material inputs into the economy each year) is only 8.6%. If global circularity doubled (to 17%), global emissions could be reduced by 39% by 2032 and put the world on track for staying below a 2-degree temperature rise.v Relevance to Dell Technologies The rise of the Age of Information, along with society’s traditional approach to the use of materials has resulted in e-waste becoming one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world – more than 50 million metric tons every year or approximately 16 pounds for every person on the planet. Less than 20% of that gets formally recycled (4% winds up in waste streams and the fate of the other 76% is unclear – possibly dumped, traded, or recycled under inferior conditions).vi As a global technology company, we have a responsibility to change the system - taking back as much as possible for reuse or responsible recycling. Accomplishing this is a major undertaking that requires ingenuity, innovation, and investment. It also requires working with our suppliers, partners, NGOs and customers not only to advance the demand for circularity but also how we meet that demand and measure progress. In addition to our focus on accelerating the circular economy across our product portfolio, we are also pursuing circularity in how we run our business such as powering facilities with renewable electricity and sourcing office equipment that is based on a circular model. Dell Technologies’ position At Dell Technologies, we believe we have a responsibility to protect and enrich our planet together with our customers, suppliers and communities. It is a core part of our business and we embed sustainability and ethical practices into all that we do, being accountable for our actions while driving improvements wherever and whenever possible. It's why we have set ambitious goals which we report on annually in our annual Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report. The goals that most directly intersect with the circular economy include: • By 2030, for every metric ton of our products a customer buys, one metric ton will be reused or recycled, 100% of our packaging will be made from recycled or renewable material or will utilize reused packaging and more than half of our product content will be made from recycled, renewable or reduced carbon emissions material. • The materials and manufacturing processes we use to create our products also impact our goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050. Our net zero goal is an extension of our aggressive 2030 emissions goals and will require global cooperation across many aspects of our business and sustained engagement with our entire value chain to achieve. Circularity is a business imperative for Dell Technologies. In addition to setting these ambitious goals to push ourselves to move from incremental to impactful change, a shift to a circular economy offers potential cost savings and aligns us with customer requirements and future regulations. It will help us stay on the path to net zero carbon emissions, attract and keep talent, and build brand equity while demonstrating our commitment to making a positive social impact. To achieve circularity, we must incorporate new approaches to design and manufacturing that eliminate the concept of waste. Recycled and renewable sources must become the norm – both as the building blocks of our technologies and for powering our operations. We must also use purposeful design and explore new business models to extend product lifecycles and make it easy to recover materials when reuse or remanufacturing isn’t viable. Beyond embracing our responsibilities and innovating our approaches, circularity also represents a tremendous opportunity for technology to help global efforts to restore balance to our planetary systems. Technologies like AI/ML, advanced data storage, IoT and blockchain are among the many tools available to help our customers change their own systems and processes. Transitioning to a circular economy is a complicated endeavor. We must partner broadly, becoming advocates and influencers that work within our industry and customers, and across our communities to drive change. Designing for circularity A sustainable approach to materials use begins with guidelines and approaches for how components are designed and then come together to form complete systems. This focus creates significant opportunities to minimize material use, prevent waste and enable easy repair, reuse and recyclability. Our design guidelines encourage a reduction in the size and number of needed components, the amount of material needed for each component and the complexity of system assembly. Not only does this reduce the amount of material we need and potentially reduce the system’s carbon footprint, but it can also enable easier repairs by simplifying disassembly and reassembly processes. Design principles such as repairability, modularity, standard tools and fasteners, and a preference for snap fits or uniform screws over adhesives help extend the service life of our products, while making it easier for technicians and customers to reach and replace components. Design affects how easy it is to reuse/refurbish components or harvest recyclable materials at the end of a device’s life. Because we design with durability and modularity in mind, parts that come back through our services network can often be put back into our supply chain to be used to repair and refurbish systems. For those components that cannot be reused, our design focus on easy disassembly – paired with clear markings, minimized paintings and coatings, and simplified material choices – makes it easy for the recycling industry to recover more material, and recover that material more quickly. Material selection and sourcing Waste is not the only cause of negative environmental impacts. Extraction of raw materials from the ground, along with subsequent processing to enable use, can carry significant social and environmental outcomes. Accordingly, material selection and sourcing are key aspects of Dell’s approach to circularity. Dell prioritizes the use of recycled and renewable materials in both products and packaging. Recycled materials can dramatically reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing. Renewable materials help minimize negative environmental impacts by relying on natural resources that can be replenished generation after generation without depleting stocks. Dell takes a layered approach to the use of recycled materials, preserving as much value as possible from recovered materials and components. We look for the tightest possible loops. Reuse, followed by refurbished parts at scale, form the innermost loops. Dell then looks to closed loops within our value chain, where materials are recovered and potentially reprocessed from e-waste and re-engineered for use in new products. Beyond that, we look to open product loops with other value chains and industries – obtaining materials from other recycling streams or even from waste or environmental pollutants. Renewable materials come from natural resources that can be replenished, generation after generation, without depleting stocks. Our use of renewable materials is most often seen in the use of plant-based materials. Some cases are straightforward – such as renewably harvested forestry products used for packaging. In other instances, our materials sources may be more innovative or novel – for example turning plant-based oils into recyclable plastics. The key in each case is to ensure that the original feedstock can be replenished, does not take food out of the system (e.g., using corn or soy), and is treated in a way that allows the nutrients to be returned to the earth. Our view on renewable resources even extends to the use of energy throughout our value chain, embracing the use of renewably generated electricity. As such, we are committed to transitioning our own electricity to 100% renewables and advocating for others to do the same. Repair, reuse and recycling Repair is essential to keep products in use longer and out of landfills. The growing conversation around repair with our internal and external stakeholders is an important one and an opportunity to evolve Dell’s leadership, providing additional routes to make repair more accessible and affordable. At Dell Technologies, we have long supported customers’ choice to repair their own device or seek out another convenient repair option. When making repair choices, customer safety and data privacy also need to be taken into consideration. We define repairability as: • Intentionally designing products with features that enable easier repair, whether that’s by a Dell technician or by the customer. We use snap fits or uniform screws for assembly that can be opened with commonly available tools and use paints and coating for plastics that are compatible with recycling. Our engineers work collaboratively with leading repair and recycling companies, researchers, and standards to learn about the challenges and improve repairability of our products. • Providing customers with easy access to the resources, spare parts and support they need should they wish to repair their products themselves. We make it easy to access information online, including manuals and downloads that keep products performing (SW, drivers, BIOS, firmware, OS, security patches). We also publish our parts list online and customers can order those parts to conduct their own repairs. We even created the Dell AR Assistant, an augmented reality app that provides step-by-step part replacement instructions for almost 100 Dell products for many customer-addressable issues. • Offering and supporting multiple repair options across global markets that have that safety, quality, data security and privacy built in. We have been supporting repairability for decades and drive ourselves to make repair safer and easier for our customers in the future. It’s good for consumers from a convenience, financial and data privacy perspective, and good for Dell, improving customer satisfaction and increasing our ability to harvest components for reuse and recycling. Central to our commitment to the circular economy is the idea that nothing should go to waste. It’s why we have a goal that by 2030 we will reuse or recycle an equivalent product for everyone sold. To support this ambition, we provide a variety of secure recycling solutions for consumers and business customers around the world. For consumers we offer free prepaid shipping and easy logistics for consumers to mail back their used electronics and printer supplies – any brand, in any condition - to be responsibly recycled, for free. Dell's Asset Recovery Services provide commercial customers responsible asset management for retired technology of any brand - handling pickup logistics, data sanitization, resale for value back, and responsible recycling of any brand of owned or leased hardware - plus detailed reporting of each system's journey from collection to final disposition. Where repair or reuse is not possible at a product’s end-of-life we use closed-loop strategies, recycling select materials from out-of-use technology to create new products, for a reduced environmental impact. Materials from recycled equipment that cannot be reused in our own manufacturing is then offered to the broader market, helping keep material in the wider open-loop economy. Circular business innovations Circularity requires taking a holistic view of managing technology assets across their lifecycle. Leasing options through Dell Financial Services and other as-a-Service offerings creates opportunities to maximize product utilization, improve logistics and otherwise reduce environmental impacts, taking advantage of Dell’s scale and efficiencies. For example, end-of-lease equipment is processed through our efficient take-back services – which first identifies equipment that can be remanufactured and resold, and then ensures materials are recycled responsibly when all reuse opportunities have been exhausted. Dell is committed to exploring other innovative ways of delivering value via circular principles. We are working on ways that technology can be used to extend the life of hardware assets - using AI/ML to predict performance issues, perform maintenance and enable augmented reality-assisted repairs. We are also exploring how hardware devices can have several reincarnations, with components cascading across multiple lifecycles. For example, enabling top-tier performing processors used for business or gaming, to have a second, and possibly third lifetime in home or education environments - ensuring the same components are used in multiple generations of product. Partnering broadly to accelerate this transition across the economy No individual company or organization has the breadth or scale necessary to drive a global shift in the relationship between society and material use. Shifting the world to a new economic paradigm requires holistic mobilization. We must engage with customers, suppliers, peers and competitors (via pre-competitive groups) to identify best practices, listen to needs and support broad initiatives. Our membership in the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP) is a great example of this in action. Convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the CEP brings together leaders from industry, government, international organizations and civil society to collaborate at a global level on an industry roadmap for circular electronics. We also must engage with policymakers and regulators in ways that stimulate innovation and investment, remove barriers, and take advantage of technology to transition other areas of the economy. Dell understands this and is committed to continuing its long-standing leadership, working both within its industry and across industries to drive impactful change. Through innovation and collaboration, Dell will deliver on its commitment to drastically reduce waste and keep even more circular materials in the economy, shrinking resource use and greenhouse gas emissions in pursuit of a net zero future.

Relevant Content: Bio-based PCB substrates derived from cellulose, lignin, starch, and natural fiber composites are gaining attention for their biodegradability and renewability. Companies like Jiva Materials have developed commercially viable alternatives such as Soluboard, which dissolves in hot water, allowing for the easy recovery of components and materials without toxic processing. These materials can match traditional epoxy-based laminates in thermal and electrical performance for low-to-medium power applications, while drastically reducing end-of-life disposal issues. [...] Additive manufacturing (3D printing), though still emerging for PCBs, is enabling more sustainable production models by reducing substrate waste, shortening design-to-manufacture cycles, and enabling on-demand, local manufacturing. Materials such as conductive inks based on silver nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes allow for the printing of flexible, lightweight PCBs with reduced energy input and material consumption. Researchers are also exploring inkjet-printed biodegradable PCBs, which could be suitable for transient electronics, such as medical implants or disposable sensors. [...] Circular manufacturing also involves innovative recovery technologies. Methods such as cryogenic separation, laser ablation, chemical-free PCB depopulation, and bioleaching (using bacteria to extract metals from e-waste) are being explored to increase recovery efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

 Despite the promise, the pace of circular transition across the industry remains uneven and relatively slow. Several challenges persist:

 As global demand for electronic devices accelerates—driven by rapid advancements in consumer electronics, automotive technology, industrial automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT)—the environmental footprint of the electronics industry is drawing increased and justified scrutiny. The production of electronic components, from printed circuit boards (PCBs) and semiconductors to capacitors, resistors, connectors, and plastic housings, is resource-intensive and heavily reliant on processes that consume vast amounts of energy, water, and rare materials. These processes often involve hazardous substances, such as lead, mercury, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and toxic solvents, which pose significant risks to both human health and the environment.

 Compounding the issue is the industry’s continued dependence on a linear manufacturing model, where devices are designed for short-term use and are rarely built with reuse, repair, or recyclability in mind. As a result, mountains of electronic waste (e-waste) are generated every year—much of it ending up in landfills or informal recycling hubs, where it releases harmful pollutants and fails to recover valuable materials like gold, palladium, and rare earth elements. The United Nations estimates that over 62 million metric tonnes of e-waste were generated globally in 2023, a number expected to rise sharply unless significant reforms are adopted.

 Yet, in the face of these environmental challenges, a transformative shift is underway. Innovations in eco-friendly materials, closed-loop manufacturing, sustainable product design, and recycling systems are offering a new vision for the future of electronics—one that balances technological progress with environmental responsibility. From biodegradable PCB substrates and halogen-free laminates to circular design principles and urban mining technologies, stakeholders across the value chain are investing in more sustainable alternatives.

 This evolving landscape is being shaped not only by environmental necessity but also by regulatory pressure, consumer demand for greener products, and global initiatives aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The electronics sector—historically seen as a contributor to environmental degradation—is now at a pivotal point where it can become a catalyst for circular economy practices, leading the charge in decarbonizing industry, conserving resources, and reducing waste through innovation and accountability.

 As we delve deeper into the strategies and solutions being developed, it becomes clear that sustainability in electronic components is no longer a future aspiration—it is a present-day imperative with growing momentum across both industry and policy spheres.

**The Environmental Impact of Electronic Components** The environmental impact of electronic components is significant and multifaceted, spanning the entire lifecycle of a product—from raw material extraction and component manufacturing to product use and end-of-life disposal. Each stage presents its own set of ecological challenges, contributing to climate change, resource depletion, and pollution.

 One of the most pressing concerns is the use of hazardous substances in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs), which form the foundation of virtually all electronic devices. Traditional PCB production involves heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and mercury, as well as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These substances pose risks not only to human health during production and handling but also to ecosystems when devices are discarded improperly.

 Equally problematic is the semiconductor fabrication process, which is among the most resource-intensive sectors in the electronics industry. Semiconductor manufacturing requires enormous quantities of ultrapure water, energy, and toxic chemicals such as arsine, phosphine, and hydrofluoric acid. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), data centers and semiconductor fabs combined consumed over 2% of global electricity in 2023, with projections indicating continued growth as AI and high-performance computing demand increases. The carbon footprint of semiconductor production is particularly high in countries reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

 Meanwhile, the world's escalating dependence on digital devices—from smartphones and wearables to industrial control systems and electric vehicles—has led to an explosion of electronic waste (e-waste). The Global E-waste Monitor 2024 by UNITAR and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates that over 62 million metric tonnes of e-waste were generated worldwide in 2023. Shockingly, only about 17.4% of this was formally collected and recycled, and the trend is worsening. By 2030, the global collection and recycling rate is projected to drop to just 20%, primarily due to inadequate recycling infrastructure, lack of consumer awareness, and inconsistent regulatory enforcement in many regions.

 This uncollected e-waste often ends up in landfills or informal recycling hubs, especially in developing countries, where it poses severe health and environmental risks. Toxic substances from decomposing electronics can leach into groundwater or release carcinogenic dioxins during incineration. Informal recycling practices, such as open-air burning and acid baths used to extract metals, contribute heavily to air and soil pollution, impacting nearby communities and biodiversity.

 The environmental cost is also economic: according to the United Nations University (UNU), the raw materials embedded in e-waste—gold, platinum, palladium, copper, and rare earth elements—are worth over US$57 billion annually. Yet most of this value is lost due to poor recycling systems.

 In light of these challenges, there is a growing consensus among industry leaders, governments, and environmental organizations that a fundamental redesign of electronics manufacturing and distribution systems is urgently needed. This includes rethinking the materials used, minimizing resource consumption, and building robust infrastructure for collection, reuse, and safe recycling. It also involves embedding sustainability principles at the design stage, often referred to as “Design for Environment” (DfE), which includes strategies such as modular design for easy repair, use of biodegradable or recyclable materials, and reduction of component complexity.

 Additionally, initiatives like the European Union’s Green Deal, Right to Repair laws, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) frameworks are gaining traction globally. These regulatory frameworks are pushing manufacturers to take accountability for the full lifecycle of their products, encouraging eco-innovation and circular economy models.

 In summary, the environmental impact of electronic components is a critical concern that extends far beyond production. It encompasses systemic issues in energy use, toxic material handling, and waste management. Without decisive action and cross-sector collaboration, the industry risks exacerbating planetary boundaries. But with the integration of sustainable design principles, responsible sourcing, and effective recycling systems, there is a clear path forward—one that aligns technological progress with environmental protection.

![Image 5: Sustainability in Electronic Components: Eco-Friendly Materials and Recycling Initiatives](https://cdn.induportals-media-publishing.org/Press%20Files/09/62/13/96213-5.jpg)

**Sustainable PCB Manufacturing: Eco-Friendly Materials and Innovations** Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), the foundational elements of virtually all electronic devices, are among the most environmentally burdensome components due to their complex construction, intensive material requirements, and chemically harsh fabrication processes. Traditional PCBs typically consist of fiberglass-reinforced epoxy resins laminated with copper layers and treated with a host of chemicals during etching, plating, and cleaning. These steps often involve toxic heavy metals such as lead and chromium, halogenated flame retardants, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), all of which pose risks to workers and contribute to air, water, and soil pollution if not properly managed.

 While regulatory frameworks like the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and REACH directives have prompted the industry to transition away from some of the most dangerous substances, including lead and cadmium, challenges remain. The widely adopted lead-free solder alloys, such as tin-silver-copper (SAC), while less toxic, still depend on the extraction of finite resources like silver and copper—processes that involve significant energy use, habitat disruption, and environmental degradation. Furthermore, these alloys may suffer from thermal fatigue issues, especially in high-reliability applications, raising questions about their long-term durability and sustainability.

 In response, a new wave of research and innovation is reshaping the sustainability landscape of PCB manufacturing: 

*   **Bio-based PCB substrates** derived from cellulose, lignin, starch, and natural fiber composites are gaining attention for their biodegradability and renewability. Companies like Jiva Materials have developed commercially viable alternatives such as Soluboard, which dissolves in hot water, allowing for the easy recovery of components and materials without toxic processing. These materials can match traditional epoxy-based laminates in thermal and electrical performance for low-to-medium power applications, while drastically reducing end-of-life disposal issues.
*   **Green chemistry innovations** are replacing traditional toxic solvents and etching agents with water-based solutions, ionic liquids, and supercritical CO₂. These alternatives reduce worker exposure to harmful chemicals, cut down on wastewater treatment costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from volatile organic compounds.
*   **Additive manufacturing** (3D printing), though still emerging for PCBs, is enabling more sustainable production models by reducing substrate waste, shortening design-to-manufacture cycles, and enabling on-demand, local manufacturing. Materials such as conductive inks based on silver nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes allow for the printing of flexible, lightweight PCBs with reduced energy input and material consumption. Researchers are also exploring inkjet-printed biodegradable PCBs, which could be suitable for transient electronics, such as medical implants or disposable sensors.
*   **Embedded component technology** is helping reduce the number of discrete parts needed on a PCB, decreasing overall size and material usage. This design approach also improves electrical performance and thermal management, contributing indirectly to energy efficiency.
*   **Implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools** has become critical for evaluating the true environmental impact of PCB manufacturing. LCA helps identify carbon hotspots, water usage, and material inefficiencies throughout the value chain—from raw material extraction to end-of-life management—enabling manufacturers to optimize design and production decisions for minimal environmental harm.
*   Furthermore, **renewable energy integration** in PCB fabrication plants is emerging as a trend, with companies investing in solar panels, battery storage systems, and energy-efficient HVAC solutions to reduce Scope 2 emissions. For example, leading EMS providers in Europe and Japan have already begun reporting emissions reductions through such facility upgrades.

 In combination, these innovations represent a significant departure from the conventional PCB manufacturing model, offering new pathways to reduce toxicity, energy consumption, and waste. However, the adoption of sustainable PCB solutions is still uneven across the industry, with cost, performance trade-offs, and limited standardization posing hurdles to widespread implementation. Scaling these technologies—especially among small and mid-sized manufacturers—will require not only technological refinement but also policy support, supply chain incentives, and market demand for greener electronics. Nonetheless, the momentum is building, and sustainable PCB manufacturing is poised to play a pivotal role in the broader decarbonization and circularity of the electronics industry.

**Circular Manufacturing and End-of-Life Management** To further enhance sustainability in the electronics sector, the adoption of a circular manufacturing model is becoming an increasingly critical strategy. Unlike the traditional linear model of ""take, make, dispose,"" circular manufacturing seeks to maximize the lifecycle of materials through reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling—drastically reducing the demand for virgin raw materials and minimizing waste.

 In this model, Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and other components are designed with ease of disassembly in mind, allowing for the retrieval of valuable and finite resources such as gold, silver, copper, palladium, and rare earth elements. Design features like non-permanent adhesives, standardized fasteners, and layered modular assemblies make it easier to separate components at the end of a product’s life. This is especially vital as raw material prices soar and concerns grow over supply chain vulnerabilities and conflict minerals.

 Modular product design plays a central role in circularity. By allowing individual components—such as memory chips, sensors, batteries, and display units—to be upgraded or replaced independently, manufacturers can extend the useful life of a product without having to replace the entire system. Notable examples include the Fairphone, which enables users to swap out cameras, batteries, and processors with minimal tools, and Framework’s modular laptops, which are built entirely around repairability and upgradeability.

 Several companies and programs are already implementing circular practices: 

*   Apple uses disassembly robots like Daisy and Dave to recover components from returned devices and extract rare materials for reuse in new products. Apple also reuses materials such as recycled cobalt in batteries, reclaimed gold in logic boards, and recycled aluminium in enclosures.
*   Cisco launched a Takeback and Reuse Program which recovers old networking equipment from customers and reintroduces parts into new systems. In FY2023, Cisco reused or recycled nearly 99.9% of returned hardware by weight.
*   Dell operates one of the largest global electronics recycling programs and incorporates recycled plastics, carbon fiber, and rare earth magnets into new products. It also partners with recycling centers and NGOs in developing countries to create responsible e-waste infrastructure.
*   Panasonic and Sony have invested in facilities for closed-loop plastic recycling, enabling them to produce new devices using plastics reclaimed from older units, thereby cutting down both plastic waste and oil dependency.

Circular manufacturing also involves innovative recovery technologies. Methods such as cryogenic separation, laser ablation, chemical-free PCB depopulation, and bioleaching (using bacteria to extract metals from e-waste) are being explored to increase recovery efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

 Despite the promise, the","## 6. Regulatory and Market Drivers for Sustainability

### By Louise Koch, Stephen Roberts, and Justine Esta Ellis

**Chapter 24**  
*Putting Purpose into Practice: The Economics of Mutuality*Oxford University Press, 2021

### **Introduction**

Dell is one of the world’s largest computer manufacturers and technology companies. The company sells a wide range of IT hardware, software products, and services for enterprise, government, small business, and consumer markets.1 As a privately held company, Dell has the freedom to pursue a longer time horizon and to commit to changing how it uses its resources. The principle of efficiency is central to the Dell business model and informs the company’s approach to resources, sourcing, and waste management.

### **Pain Points in the Ecosystem**

Dell’s commitment to efficiency has prompted the company to take on the timely challenge of improving e-waste disposal throughout its business.

E-waste, that is, discarded electrical and electronic equipment, is the world’s fastest-growing waste stream.2 Rapid technology innovation and ever-shortening product lifespans are contributing to the increase of e-waste.3 According to a United Nations’ University report, the amount of global e-waste reached 41.8 million tonnes in 2014.4 To compound matters, e-waste has a low overall recycling rate, which means that unwanted equipment remains unused.

Responsible e-waste disposal is not only important from an environmental perspective, but also makes good economic sense.5 Vast amounts of gold, for example, exit the economy due to low recycling rates, but increasingly there is an opportunity to recapture that value, as a tonne of computer motherboards contains more gold in it than a tonne of gold ore. In terms of scale, the material value of global e-waste was estimated to be €48 billion in 2014 alone.6 This underutilized resource has a vast ‘untapped potential to create a more sustainable, efficient product ecosystem’.7

The circular economy takes the traditional, linear model of ‘take, make, and dispose’—which moves products from design to factory to consumer to landfill—and bends it into a more efficient closed-loop ecosystem. Unwanted used electronics can be taken back for refurbishment and then resold on the secondary market. Products beyond repair, or those that are no longer economical to repair, are recycled to allow for precious and scarce materials to be recovered. Recycled content can either be incorporated into the design and manufacturing of new products or sold for others to use.

Research shows that approximately 30 per cent of consumers have technology products lying around the house unused, and half of consumers are unsure about what to do with their old electronics.8 According to Dell, similar situations exist with businesses warehousing old equipment. Take-back options make it easy for a wide variety of customers to dispose of their old electronic products in a responsible manner. This measure ensures that unwanted electronics get reused or, if at the end of life, properly recycled.

Plastic is one of the most useful and important materials in modern society. It is popular in computers due to its durability, ease of fabrication into complex shapes, and electrical insulation qualities.9 However, plastic recycling remains challenging and, as a result, the material constitutes a major contributor to landfills and to nonpoint source pollution—pollution from many different sources. The production of traditional plastics also uses a substantial amount of fossil fuels. Manufacturing plastics from fuel is resource intensive, requires large amounts of energy, and releases relatively high levels of CO2 emissions in the process. Recent research has shown that our current use of plastics will become unsustainable if we do not take steps to improve recycling and reduce plastics’ usage.

Using secondary, recycled plastic as feedstock for new computers presents one possible solution. With the fast pace of innovation and product upgrades in the ICT sector, recycled content can reduce the environmental toll of manufacturing with virgin materials. The circular economy and the development of secondary raw material markets are high on the European agenda. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to find a sufficient supply of high-quality post-consumer recycled plastics that meets the technical, economic, and aesthetic requirements of ICT products manufacturers.10

### **Business Strategy**

In response, Dell is taking steps towards creating a ‘circular’ supply chain (see also Interface, Chapter 25). In addition to environmental concerns, the increased volatility in commodities and growing pressure on resources have alerted Dell to the business necessity of rethinking materials and energy use.11 In 2013, Dell committed to putting a total of 50 million pounds weight of recycled materials back into its products by 2020. The company reached this goal at the beginning of 2017 and is continuing to scale its efforts.

For Dell, sourcing post-consumer recycled plastics from the market and building a new, stable closed-loop supply chain for plastics from used electronics collected through take-back programmes present viable and affordable alternatives to using virgin materials. Rather than focusing exclusively on individual challenges, Dell has taken steps to approach their supply chain from a broader, systemic perspective. Most recently, this has included expanding its efforts to also address precious metals, such as gold. Jennifer Allison, director of supply chain sustainability at Dell, summarizes the company’s current business strategy:

We’re talking about systems—not just products, programmes, or initiatives. Looking at the whole system is when change begins to make a significant difference. Technology is a great tool for measuring and analysing systems, understanding processes, and identifying inefficiencies.12

In this way, Dell takes a whole ecosystem view of its product life cycles. This approach is transforming the design of products and services. Dell’s life-cycle approach aims to keep viable products and parts in circulation for longer periods of time. It also harnesses global efforts to reuse, refurbish, and resell products and parts to extend their lifetimes and to recycle them at the end of life.

Product design emphasizes ease of repair and recyclability from the beginning. Dell also looks continuously for ways to incorporate sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic and reclaimed carbon fibre, into products and packaging.13

### The Take-Back Programme

Dell has the world’s largest electronics take-back programme, which spans more than seventy-five countries and territories. The programme has recovered approximately 800,000 tonnes of electronics since 2008. For commercial customers, Dell offers a full-spectrum of logistics and disposal capabilities via the Asset Resale and Recycling Service. Current capabilities include data security, on-site shredding, recycling, and full traceability reporting. Dell also makes it easy for individual consumers to recycle by partnering with freight companies to provide free mail-back recycling of Dell-branded equipment. In many countries, the pro-gramme will even pick up used equipment from a customer’s home.14

Another programme designed to make the recovery of obsolete electronics easier and more accessible is the Dell Reconnect Partnership with Goodwill, a not-for-profit organization committed to helping people become independent through education and training. The Reconnect Programme allows people to drop off any brand of used electronics to more than two thousand participating Goodwill locations across the United States. Dell Reconnect accepts any brand of computer equipment in any condition from consumers and provides free recycling services.

Dell returns all proceeds to Goodwill in order to help support Goodwill’s mission of putting people to work.15 By participating in this initiative, customers simultaneously help protect the environment, benefit the community, and receive a receipt for tax purposes. In this way, the programme helps both the customers and the business.

The donated equipment has value as a whole system, as parts, and sometimes as raw materials such as metals, plastics, and glass.16 If the equipment can be refurbished, Goodwill sells it. If not, the end-of-life product is sent to Wistron, one of Dell’s recycling partners, for asset recovery in the United States. Metals such as tin, gold,17 and tungsten are re-sold in the commodities market. To complete the closed loop, plastics are sorted and shipped to China, turned into pellets, and mixed with virgin plastics for use in new Dell products.18

### Closed-Loop Recycled Plastic Supply Chain

Dell’s 2020 ‘Legacy of Good’ sustainability plan set the goal of incorporating 50 million pounds weight of post-consumer recycled-content plastics and other sustainable materials into Dell products by 2020.19 Dell met this target ahead of schedule in early 2017.

It started with the launch of Dell’s closed-loop recycled plastics supply chain in 2014. Since then, the company has used more than 9,750 tonnes of closed-loop plastics in over 125 products. These products include flat-panel monitors, desktops, and all-in-one computers.

Run in conjunction with various supply chain partners, the programme consists of collecting, recycling, and using e-waste to make new Dell products.20 It begins with sorting plastics out of the various take-back streams, further processing them, and then sending them to a manufacturing partner in Asia. The plastics are then melted down and moulded into new parts and computer components, thereby creating a closed-loop system. The whole process—from the time the equipment is received for recycling to the time the plastics are back in a customer’s hands as part of a new product—takes just under six months. The closed-loop system also provides businesses with a price more stable than the cost of virgin materials, which fluctuates with the price of oil. It also reduces the company’s dependence on those environmentally costly virgin materials. Furthermore, by reusing plastics already in circulation, Dell cuts down on e-waste, reduces carbon emissions, and helps drive a circular economy for IT. The closed-loop process yields an 11 per cent lower carbon footprint than a process using virgin materials,21 and creates products that are better for the environment, which is increasingly what Dell customers demand.22 Dell was also the first PC manufacturer (January 2018) to use recycled gold from e-waste in its products. Working with the data analyst TruCost, it found that this closed-loop process can cause 99 per cent less environmental damage and avoid $1.6 million in natural capital costs per kilogram processed (US$3.68 million for the pilot project alone) when compared to gold mining. The same study showed closed-loop process can avoid 41 times the social impacts of gold mining.

Dell’s leadership in recovering and reusing plastic from used computers constitutes an important step in moving the larger electronics industry towards a circular economy. Louise Koch, corporate sustainability director in EMEA for Dell, describes the impetus for initiating a closed-loop system:

Dell’s programme is driven by both an effort to improve efficiency—a principle that goes back to its founding ethos and business model—as well as a commitment to reducing environmental impact.23

The use of closed-loop plastics may create a demand for plastic from used computers and thereby increase the level of plastic recycling from electronics. This, in turn, generates new jobs and opportunities for those in the nascent industry, all while staying true to Dell’s founding principles.

### Challenges in Moving to a Closed-Loop Recycling System

In moving from the traditional take–make–dispose linear supply chain to a circular supply chain, Dell has had to overcome a number of hurdles.

One of the biggest challenges that Dell faced with the closed-loop recycling was identifying which types of plastic can be incorporated back into new products. As Scott O’Connell, director of environmental affairs for Dell, puts it, ‘When dealing with plastics, getting the properties equivalent or better to virgin materials isn’t easy . . . But this is a challenge we’ve been able to overcome with engineering know-how.’24 Dell worked with partners to test different approaches. Testing revealed that, due to mechanical and aesthetic considerations, a blend of recycled-content with virgin plastic produces the best outcomes.

Another challenge involves establishing a reliable closed-loop supply chain. As O’Connell describes, ‘We had to make sure that we had sufficient volume of product coming in to be able to yield enough plastics to put into a mainstream Dell product.’25 Supply of products and plastic derives from Dell’s own sources, which adds a greater degree of insight and security. However, for the closed-loop recycling to work and scale, Dell needs security of supply, which can be difficult to attain with fluctuating numbers of products collected through take-back. Shrinking form factors—the fact that there is less plastic per item recycled as electronics become smaller—further complicate the situation. Hence Dell needs to continue to drive increasing participation in take-back programmes, while at the same time exploring other means of acquiring recycled-content materials.

Transporting materials poses an additional challenge. Dell customers are all over the world, which means that take-back initiatives must accommodate the global scale. While Dell has a small closed-loop plastics supply chain in Europe already and is exploring ways to scale in other geographies, materials need to be collected in sufficiently large amounts to make shipping to a centralized processor worth the economic and environmental costs. This involves logistics, regulations, and other considerations. In some cases, even the definition of the material being moved can affect the viability of closed-loop efforts: is recycled plastic labelled as waste or a raw material, for example?

The final challenge for Dell is to demonstrate the benefits of closed-loop recycling to customers. Ultimately, the products look and perform exactly the same as those made from virgin materials. Dell must communicate the value proposition to customers by highlighting the amount materials, and the benefits to the customers’ own sustainability goals.

### **Performance**

Since 2008, Dell has taken back more than 1.76 billion pounds (nearly 800,000 tonnes) of used electronics and since mid-2014, when Dell launched the closed-loop plastic recycling programme, it has created nearly 5,000 tonnes of plastics from recycled computer parts. Dell has saved more than $1.8 million from this process, and the carbon footprint of circular plastics is 11 per cent smaller than that associated with the manufacture of virgin plastics. Dell now uses circular plastics in approximately 125 products across millions of units globally.

Together with TruCost, Dell has completed an evaluation to understand the gains from moving away from virgin plastics. One of the most useful ways for companies to assess the risks associated with new initiatives is to quantify the environmental impacts generated by their activities—internal operations, upstream supply chain, and downstream product use and disposal—and then convert those impacts into monetary values.26 The monetary value helps identify the value not captured in traditional financial markets and incorporates these considerations into decision-making.27

Findings showed that Dell’s closed-loop plastic has a 44 per cent ($1.3 million annually) greater environmental benefit than virgin ABS plastic.28 In particular, increased computer recycling lessened environmental impacts. The research found that recovering and recycling the used plastics from computers minimized ‘human health and ecotoxicity impacts’ and reduced the overall emission of hazardous substances.29

Dell has also begun to incorporate social impact metrics into its valuation framework.30 Emergent strategies such as analysing activities for their use of social and human capital are likely to be an area for further refinement and application in the future.31 At present, Dell is combining both environmental and social impact metrics into its process in order to help tackle the challenge of responsible e-waste disposal.

### **Prognosis**

* On a global scale, there is still huge potential to scale up circular resource streams in the IT sector and beyond. Only 10 per cent of the plastics produced today are recovered—and more than 50 per cent end up in landfills.
* Dell has increased the use of recycled materials (both closed-loop and traditional post-consumer recycled materials) in new products and plans to continue to scale the programme.
* As Dell continues to scale the current programme, it will look to expand into reclaiming and reusing other materials. Dell has already had success with using reclaimed carbon fibre for products and is currently using recycled ocean plastics ink made from captured diesel emissions for packaging.
* Dell will also look at how ocean plastics or other solutions can be used with products.
* Dell will continue to measure social impact using the same methodology, updating models for collection totals to follow form-factor trends. It will report progress annually, building on this total toward a cumulative 2 billion pounds by 2020.32
* Dell continues to lead conversations with governments and industry partners about recycling and circular loops on a global scale. Dell is open to innovative collaborations with even more customers, partners, and governments in the coming years. Dell sees particular opportunities in creating partnerships in developing countries to strengthen this ecosystem.

Dell’s take-back programme presents a compelling example of the potential of circular economy and closed-loop systems to contribute to responsible, mutual business practices. Looking towards the future, creating closed-loop recycling programmes in developing countries represents a new frontier. Recycling products in the countries from which they are recovered brings skilled jobs, creates industry, and strengthens the local economy.33 Using its proven abilities to leverage partnerships and government relationships to create the infrastructure needed for new programmes, Dell can continue driving a culture of recycling in communities around the world.34 As Dell’s programme example highlights, collaborative approaches have the potential to create both financial and environmental savings for corporations and customers on a global scale.

Dell integrates modular design into PCs to tackle e-waste, with replaceable components supporting sustainability goals and extended product lifecycles

The technology industry faces a mounting environmental challenge as global consumption of electronic devices continues to accelerate. Rapid innovation cycles, coupled with limited product lifespans and poor recycling infrastructure, have created an unsustainable pattern of resource extraction, manufacturing and disposal that threatens to undermine the sector’s progress.

The scale of global e-waste presents a significant challenge for technology manufacturers. Each year, more than 60 million tonnes of electronic waste are created according to United Nations figures. This volume has been increasing by more than 2.6 million tonnes annually, putting e-waste production projections at 82 million tonnes by 2030 if current trends continue.

Electronic waste represents the fastest-growing waste stream worldwide, outpacing effective recycling solutions and creating significant environmental hazards. The toxic materials contained in discarded devices – including lead, mercury and flame retardants – can contaminate soil and water supplies when improperly handled, while valuable materials such as gold, copper and rare earth elements are lost when products reach landfill.

Dell Technologies is revolutionising the way computers are designed and built by implementing modular components that users can replace without specialised knowledge. This approach forms part of the company's response to the escalating global e-waste crisis, which now produces more than 62 million tonnes of discarded electronics annually.

## Dell’s Concept Luna drives PC industry towards repairability and reuse

The company’s Concept Luna initiative, launched in 2021, has moved from prototype to production with the introduction of modular components in Dell's commercial laptop range. Most significant among these innovations is a USB-C port that attaches with screws instead of solder – a seemingly small change with substantial implications for device longevity.

“Product design dictates how practical it is to reuse and refurbish components or harvest recyclable materials at the end of a device's life,” explains Maria Mohr, Sustainability Lead for the Global Presales Technical Community at Dell Technologies.

For most laptop manufacturers, damaged ports typically necessitate motherboard replacement, a costly repair that often leads to device disposal. Dell’s approach allows individual port replacement, extending device lifespan while reducing the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing new hardware.

The design isn’t limited to ports. Dell has introduced user-replaceable batteries with simplified cable connections and reduced cobalt content. Memory modules, storage drives and even keyboards can now be accessed and replaced by users following QR-coded instructions embedded in the hardware.

These modifications arrive as European regulators implement Right to Repair legislation and as consumers increasingly demand longer-lasting technology. Dell appears to be positioning itself ahead of these pressures rather than reacting to them.

## E-waste crisis prompts rethink of technology product lifecycles

World Health Organisation data cited by Dell projects e-waste growth will reach 82 million tonnes by 2030 if current consumption patterns continue. Only about one-fifth of electronics are formally recycled, with the remainder entering landfills or being processed in unregulated conditions.

This situation creates both environmental hazards and economic inefficiency. Valuable metals including gold, silver, copper and rare earth elements worth billions of pounds remain unrecovered, while toxic materials contaminate soil and water supplies.

Dell's sustainability strategy takes an unusual approach by focusing on design as the primary intervention point rather than end-of-life collection alone. While the company operates recycling programmes in more than 80 countries, it views product design as the critical factor in creating a circular economy for technology.

""Sustainability has always been integral to how we operate — woven into our processes, products and the ways we help customers achieve their goals. We take an end-to-end approach to sustainability,"" says Maria.

The company has set ambitious targets for 2030, including plans to reuse or recycle an equivalent product for every item customers purchase and to use exclusively recycled or renewable materials in packaging.

## Dell’s material strategy reduces virgin resource extraction

Material selection represents another pillar of Dell’s sustainability approach. In 2024, the company incorporated 95 million pounds of recycled and renewable materials into its products, reducing dependence on newly extracted resources.

This strategy includes using aluminium produced with renewable energy, which generates substantially fewer carbon emissions than conventional methods. Bioplastics derived from castor oil replace petroleum-based polymers in select components, while recycled steel and copper reduce mining impacts.

The company has developed a closed-loop plastic supply chain that recovers materials from end-of-life products for use in new components. These recovered plastics make up a significant portion of the housing and structural elements in Dell's commercial product lines.

Packaging has undergone a similar transformation. During fiscal year 2024, 96.4 percent of Dell's packaging materials came from recycled, renewable or reused sources. Paper-based materials have replaced foam cushioning, while single-use plastics have been eliminated from much of the company's packaging.

“I’ve often said our sustainability strategy is as simple as ‘integration everywhere,’” notes Cassandra Garber, Chief Sustainability Officer at Dell Technologies. “A perfect example of that in action is the incredible list of circular design examples we can share that span so many aspects of our new AI PCs.”

## Balancing technological advancement with environmental responsibility

As the technology industry pushes forward with AI capabilities that demand increased computing power, Dell recognises the tension between innovation and energy consumption. The company has developed frameworks for measuring and reducing the environmental impact of AI implementations while continuing to advance the technology.

Dell’s approach includes power management specifications for infrastructure, cooling systems that reduce energy use and measurement protocols for calculating the environmental return on technology investments.

The company views sustainability as a core business strategy rather than a separate initiative. Environmental metrics now integrate with financial reporting, while procurement processes include impact assessments for supplier selection.

“Sustainability and ESG commitments are now widely recognised as business imperatives that impact everything from supplier decisions to business strategy,” says Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO at Dell Technologies. “At Dell, we are both meeting our goals and helping customers meet theirs.”

This integration extends to product development, where sustainability considerations influence design decisions from inception. The modular approach in Dell’s laptops exemplifies this philosophy – making devices that last longer through repairability while reducing the resources needed for manufacturing.

For the technology industry, which has historically encouraged frequent device replacement, this represents a significant shift in business model. Dell appears to be betting that consumers and enterprise customers will value longevity and repairability alongside traditional metrics of performance and price.

“We don’t have to choose between competitive innovation and being environmentally responsible,” Maria emphasises. “Instead, we can embrace an end-to-end approach to sustainability: where resources are valued, products are designed with sustainable materials and waste is minimised.”

Growing environmental and socioeconomic risks coupled with geopolitical uncertainties have reinforced our belief that sustainability needs to be a key force for driving our competitiveness and technological innovation. To accelerate this drive, Samsung Electronics announced the New Environmental Strategy on September 15 th, 2022, and cemented our resolve to address global climate and resource challenges in cooperation with our stakeholders. With this new strategy, we plan to achieve net zero for the DX Division by 2030 and company-wide, including the DS Division, by 2050.
As a global information and communication technology (ICT) company, our responsibility is to make positive, lasting impacts throughout the value chain and society. To this end, we aim to mitigate carbon emissions by using our innovative technologies and maximizing resource circularity across the life cycle of our products. Tackling global environmental challenges requires concerted efforts from a wide range of stakeholders. We are therefore continually expanding our collaboration and partnership with various stakeholders to explore technological breakthroughs and address systemic and physical barriers. Our involvement in the Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC), Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), Decarbonizing the Use Phase of Connected Devices (DUCD), and Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) are good examples of such collaboration that strives to work across value chains and with industry peers. Another notable partnership is with Patagonia to address the issue of microplastic pollution, which led to the introduction of new wash cycle and filter that reduce the amount of microfiber released to the environment.
Samsung Electronics is also reinforcing compliance with human rights principles while promoting sustainable management practices throughout our supply chain, better serving local communities, and enabling professional growth of our employees.
In February 2023, we announced our Global Human Rights Principles as an extension of our commitment to protect human rights under the UN Message from Our CEO Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). Our Global Human Rights Principles convey our will to engage employees, suppliers, local communities, partners, and consumers in our pledge to uphold fundamental human rights. Regarding corporate social responsibility, our activities include diverse training initiatives that focus on building technical capabilities of future generations as well as donation programs that reach out to the underserved. A prime example is our Kiosk of Sharing, a program through which employees can donate to underprivileged children in the communities we serve simply by tagging their employee ID card. This program aims to foster a culture of giving among our employees, and it is currently active at all of our business sites in Korea and at select sites in Vietnam, Thailand, India, China, and the US. In line with our longstanding emphasis on cultivating talent based on our corporate philosophy of “People First,” we launched The UniverSE— The University of Samsung Electronics—in 2023. This company-wide leadership and vocational training platform is designed to help our employees develop the skills required to achieve both professional and personal growth.
We have also rolled out a data science course for our employees and suppliers to equip them with the necessary skills to excel as the future workforce in the digital transformation era.
Furthermore, we are pleased to mark 2023 as the initial year of our support to strengthen ESG performance of our suppliers. In this context, we expanded our supplier training programs to bolster their compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct and relevant laws, support climate action and resource-circularity initiatives, and adhere to labor and human rights policies. Samsung Electronics will continue to join hands with diverse stakeholders and seek innovative technology-based solutions to tackle pressing environmental and social challenges. Despite many obstacles that may lie ahead, we will move forward steadily to fulfill our goals toward a sustainable future one step at a time. We look forward to your continued support and partnership in this journey. Thank you.

# Samsung Electronics Achieves UL Solutions’ ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ Platinum Designation Across All Global Manufacturing Sites

on October 14, 2025

Samsung Electronics has achieved UL Solutions’ “Zero Waste to Landfill” Platinum designation across all of its global manufacturing sites — marking the first major milestone in the company’s environmental strategy.

“Zero Waste to Landfill” is a claim validation program administered by UL Solutions, a global safety science company. Designations are determined by the percentage of waste diverted from landfills, serving as a key indicator of a company’s resource circularity efforts. Platinum represents a 100% landfill diversion rate, while Gold and Silver represent 95% to 99% and 90% to 94% respectively.

Since announcing its Environmental Strategy in 2022, focused on climate action and resource circularity, Samsung has steadily advanced sustainable management practices — repurposing waste generated at its sites into valuable resources and expanding other recycling initiatives worldwide.

Last year, all 10 business sites of the Device Solutions (DS) Division earned Platinum designation through integrated validation. This year in July, the Device eXperience (DX) Division’s Hungarian subsidiary, SEH-P, also achieved Platinum, marking the final step in securing Platinum status across all 22 domestic and overseas DX manufacturing sites.

Samsung Electronics has established key directions for waste management — strengthening sorting systems, expanding reuse and increasing resource recovery — and has been implementing them through concrete initiatives.

Examples include introducing more refined waste separation systems within worksites and strengthening employee training to ensure thorough sorting.1 Food waste and used paper are composted,2 while general and construction waste is recycled into alternative fuels3 or basic raw materials.4 In addition, e-waste and battery residues are repurposed for solid fuel production.5 Through these efforts, Samsung has made steady progress toward its goal of achieving Zero Waste to Landfill.

Samsung is continuously developing technologies to recycle waste generated from semiconductor production processes into materials that can be reused in semiconductor manufacturing. For example, waste liquids are reused as a cleaning agent in scrubbers that reduce air pollutants and as water treatment agents in wastewater treatment facilities. In addition, adsorbents, activated carbon and catalysts used to control air pollutants undergo regeneration and are reused as raw materials for the same applications.

▲ Waste adsorbent regeneration process

Samsung recycled approximately 1.32 million tonnes of waste in 2024 — equivalent to 260,000 five-tonne waste trucks.

In addition to reducing waste at its worksites, Samsung has also repurposed by-products and discarded materials into new resources. The Galaxy S25, launched this year, has incorporated recycled cobalt extracted from previously used Galaxy smartphones and batteries discarded during the manufacturing process through Samsung’s Circular Battery Supply Chain. Discarded wafer trays from semiconductor manufacturing were recycled and applied to the Galaxy S25 series’ components as well.

Looking ahead, Samsung Electronics plans to further enhance systematic waste sorting and material-specific management to secure high-quality recycled resources and expand their application in products, strengthening its commitment to resource circularity.

Junhwa Lee, Executive Vice President and Head of Global EHS Office, DX Division at Samsung Electronics, highlighted the significance of the achievement as “a major milestone” in the company’s environmental management strategy, adding that the company will continue to apply innovation across all areas of its business to put sustainable management into practice.

# The Future of Sustainable Electronics

![The Future of Sustainable Electronics](//myteracube.com/cdn/shop/articles/unnamed-28_91109dfd-7143-46d1-839c-1624664d9da0_533x.jpg?v=1738635374)

The global demand for sustainability across all industries is growing at an all-time high, and it’s far from slowing down. This rings particularly true for the electronics industry, but it’s a brand new stomping ground for manufacturers and consumers alike. [According to a study conducted by the United Nations University](https://unu.edu/news/news/with-e-waste-predicted-to-double-by-2050-business-as-usual-is-not-an-option.html), we will have doubled our use and consumption of electronics by 2050, creating a sharp rise in the amount of manufacturing needed to keep up. If significant changes are not made to suppress the environmental impacts of electronics manufacturing and improper e-waste management, we could be facing a problem unseen before now. In the current prediction model, the amount of e-waste produced over the next 30 years will increase to over 110 million tons per year. The good news is that there is light on the horizon, with new technologies advancing our production and material sourcing that should help minimize the adverse effects seen until now. 

## **Eco-Friendly Designs**

One of the first steps toward a more sustainable future in the electronics sector is designing products with environmental impacts in mind. This can be done in many different ways, but efficiency will be the foundation for it all. Energy efficiency must take precedence in manufacturing and production, and material efficiency must become a requirement for product design. By doing so, we will not only reduce overall environmental degradation, but we can sustainably source materials without depleting resources. At the same time, eco-friendly materials will help curb pollution when e-waste is improperly managed - [which presents a severe risk to the environment and its ecosystems.](https://www.ewaste1.com/how-does-recycling-electronics-help-the-environment/) 

## **Sourcing Sustainable Raw Materials**

With e-waste pollution on the rise, it’s more important than ever that brands and manufacturers begin to sustainably source raw materials that will help prevent or reduce further destruction to the environment. Currently, electronic devices are manufactured with materials like mercury, lead, cadmium, and lithium, [all of which wreak havoc on soil, air, and water resources](https://elytus.com/blog/e-waste-and-its-negative-effects-on-the-environment.html) once they enter natural systems. Recent research has confirmed that many alternative materials can be used in place of these, including aluminum, borosilicate glass, iron alloy, and graphene. Not only will sourcing these raw materials to manufacture electronics reduce the amount of environmental degradation due to e-waste, [but it will save time, money, and energy throughout the production process.](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/alternative-energy/top-five-green-materials-for-electronics) 

## **Energy Efficient Manufacturing**

As stated earlier, energy efficiency in production is pivotal in moving toward a sustainable future in the electronics industry. While rising energy costs are a good incentive for companies to increase efficiency throughout production, the benefits seen from this would stretch to consumers and industry giants alike. Governments around the globe have begun incentivizing energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse emissions, so we are on the right track to make a positive impact on a global scale. Still, we as consumers must do our part in demanding green manufacturing for the products that are so intertwined in our lives. 

Renewable energy will also continue to receive funding and support, furthering environmental health and the fight against climate change. Wind and solar power are two of the leading green energy sources worldwide, [with offshore wind energy production increasing by 16% in 2020 alone](https://yearbook.enerdata.net/renewables/wind-solar-share-electricity-production.html). Renewable energy production even continued to rise throughout the global COVID-19 pandemic, showing just how much opportunity there is in the renewable sector. If we can continue to utilize renewable energy in electronics manufacturing, companies will have no choice but to step further into a more sustainable future. 

## **Improved Lifecycle Management**

[The lifecycle of electronics](https://www.epa.gov/smm-electronics/basic-information-about-electronics-stewardship#02) can be laid out pretty straightforwardly, but it’s not always as simple as it may appear on paper. For a better understanding, the general lifecycle of electronics is as follows:

While there is never one consistent roadmap for a particular product, better lifecycle management can be implemented to increase the likelihood of electronics being reused, refurbished, or recycled. As a consumer, the best way to help is to actively seek out avenues in which you can donate or recycle your used electronics. You can also buy green electronics (those that are sustainably manufactured) to reduce the environmental impact of products that end up where they shouldn’t. 

## **Teracube’s Commitment to Sustainable Electronics**

[Teracube](https://myteracube.com/) is proud to be a pioneer in sustainable electronics, pushing the envelope and setting a standard for other companies to follow. We recognize that the most detrimental impacts of electronics come from manufacturing process and improper e-waste management, so we designed a line of smartphones manufactured with some green materials that have a lifespan that far exceeds our competitors. All of our phones are backed by a full manufacturer warranty, giving you the confidence you need to make a responsible purchase that contributes to a sustainable future of electronics. We also manufacture our products in a way that allows you to repair and replace individual components, reducing the overall amount of e-waste that ends up in landfills. We are big supporters of the [Right to Repair](https://www.repair.org/stand-up), a movement taking aim at big tech companies that limit the options of consumers to repair their electronics, creating excess e-waste and adversely impacting the environment for the sake of a dollar. As a bonus, Teracube will plant a tree for every device sold - helping to offset our carbon footprint, as small as it may be.

## Abstract

Smart Mobile Devices (SMD)—including hardware devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables; the software systems that animate them; and the data-communication infrastructure that connects them—pose increasing sustainability challenges due to their short lifespans, high resource demands, and growing e-waste. While Sustainable Product–Service Systems (S.PSS) have been applied in various sectors to support environmental goals, limited research has addressed their application in the context of SMD. This study aims to explore how S.PSS can be tailored to support sustainability in the SMD sector. For that, it combines a literature review with a multiple-case analysis of seventeen commercial offerings to develop a conceptual framework refined through six expert interviews. Cases were coded using the classical PSS typology and other sector-specific criteria and subsequently clustered in a polarity diagram to identify designable patterns, underpinning the conceptual framework. The study contributes an S.PSS-SMD framework comprising a sector-tailored classification and sixteen archetypal models, operationalized in an archetypal map with potential opportunities. Theoretically, the study offers a sector-grounded operationalization that extends S.PSS design theory to digital product–service ecosystems. It provides a strategic decision aid for designing business models, service bundles, stakeholder roles, and lifecycle responsibilities to pursue win–win environmental and economic sustainability.

## 1. Introduction

Smart Mobile Devices (SMD) and their systems can encompass personal and connected gadgets, their embedded and cloud software, and the infrastructures that support them, including data center resources, cables, and energy [[1](#B1-sustainability-17-08524)]. They facilitate connectivity between billions of end users and the internet. However, while offering many benefits by disrupting and facilitating information and communication, they also pose risks. The widespread adoption of SMD has had significant environmental consequences [[2](#B2-sustainability-17-08524)]. In 2022, the number of active smartphones reached 8.891 billion [[3](#B3-sustainability-17-08524)], surpassing the global population of 7.9 billion [[4](#B4-sustainability-17-08524)]. The data center electricity global consumption is estimated to be between 240 and 340 terawatt-hours, accounting for 1–1.3% of the global final electricity demand, and growing by 20–40% annually [[5](#B5-sustainability-17-08524)]. It is predicted that SMD will account for around 63% of all internet traffic by 2025 [[6](#B6-sustainability-17-08524)] and produce greenhouse gas emissions that will exceed those from data centers and telecommunications networks worldwide combined [[7](#B7-sustainability-17-08524)].

A considerable number of scholars who employ Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), a widespread methodology for investigating the environmental impact of products, concur that the upstream processes (raw material acquisition and any transformation to make them usable in production) and production phases have the greatest environmental impact [[8](#B8-sustainability-17-08524),[9](#B9-sustainability-17-08524)], accounting for 70% of the total SMD lifecycle impact [[10](#B10-sustainability-17-08524),[11](#B11-sustainability-17-08524)]. Extending the lifespan of devices and reducing the demand for new production are therefore crucial strategies for minimizing environmental impacts [[8](#B8-sustainability-17-08524)]. However, the average lifespan of smart mobile devices (SMD) is only 2–3 years [[12](#B12-sustainability-17-08524)], primarily due to unsustainable supply patterns characterized by technical obsolescence [[13](#B13-sustainability-17-08524)] and excessive production [[14](#B14-sustainability-17-08524)], making it necessary to rethink the way smartphones are consumed [[15](#B15-sustainability-17-08524)]. This is a key reason for the European Union’s prioritization of the electronics and ICT (Information Communication Technology) sectors in its sustainability policies [[16](#B16-sustainability-17-08524)], making SMD a central focus in any credible narrative of a sustainable digital economy.

A Sustainable Product-Service System (S.PSS) is a business model in which the producer retains ownership and/or responsibility for its products throughout their lifecycle [[17](#B17-sustainability-17-08524)]. This approach has been recognized as a promising way of achieving environmental and economic sustainability, as it has the potential to add value to system lifecycles [[18](#B18-sustainability-17-08524)]. It can decouple revenue from the number of devices produced and provide economic incentives for producers to design devices with a longer lifespan [[8](#B8-sustainability-17-08524),[19](#B19-sustainability-17-08524)], providing more sustainable solutions. This is because, when product ownership or life cycle responsibilities remain with the producer/provider, extending product life or recycling materials allows the provider to avoid the raw material, production, distribution, and disposal costs associated with manufacturing and disposing of additional devices, increasing profit margins while reducing environmental impact. Although few companies in the SMD sector have adopted S.PSS, most initiatives have struggled to create economic incentives for designing and manufacturing durable devices because original device manufacturers are rarely positioned as central stakeholders, such as Grover, which merely leases refurbished phones produced by other brands. Fairphone attempted to overcome this misalignment through its “Fairphone-as-a-Service” pilot, which integrated in-house design and production with a subscription-based service model [[20](#B20-sustainability-17-08524)]. Despite its innovative structure, the pilot was recently suspended due to certain issues, e.g., user preferences for device customization and related privacy concerns [[21](#B21-sustainability-17-08524)], thereby exposing barriers that need to be addressed when designing S.PSS models applied to the SMD sector.

The general knowledge base in S.PSS has been maturing—e.g., Tukker’s [[22](#B22-sustainability-17-08524)] typology of Product-Service System (PSS) and Vezzoli et al.’s [[23](#B23-sustainability-17-08524)] comprehensive design methodologies (including design scenarios, tools, and guidelines, etc.). However, there are no S.PSS studies that adequately and systematically capture the specificities of the SMD ecosystem [[24](#B24-sustainability-17-08524)], where hardware–software–connectivity are coupled, and short life cycles are common. Therefore, existing S.PSS studies offer limited guidance for SMD designers and providers who must configure concrete bundles (ownership, services, performance responsibilities) under sector-specific constraints such as firmware support, data connection,

# The best green phones: Sustainable and eco-friendly smartphones

Sustainability has become a huge factor for many consumers, and people are looking for more eco-friendly options. While you might not think of tech as good for the environment, many tech companies — and smartphones — are going green.

The tech industry is responsible for tons of electronic waste and 2% to 3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, but companies are starting to take note. Many smartphone brands are making a more conscious effort by changing how they produce, ship, and package devices. There are still not a ton of sustainable phone options on the market, but you might be surprised at what models made the list.

Whether you’re looking to lower your overall carbon footprint or become a smarter consumer, we’ve rounded up the best environmentally conscious, eco-friendly, and sustainable smartphones to help you choose which one is right for you to go green.

## [iPhone 13 Pro](https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9JFS6T/ref=asc_df_B09G9JFS6T1650366000000?tag=zd-buy-button-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B09G9JFS6T&linkCode=asn&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C97c0295b-70a1-4eb7-ae01-7fe836af9f2a%7Cdtp)

### Best green phone

Apple has been instituting more and more green initiatives into every new iPhone release, and the iPhone 13 Pro is the “greenest” model yet. According to Apple’s [Product Environmental Report](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/iphone/iPhone_13_Pro_PER_Sept2021.pdf), the iPhone 13 Pro is made with 99% recycled tungsten and 98% recycled rare earth elements. It’s also the first Apple product to use 100% certified recycled gold in the plating of the main logic board.

Energy use is another huge factor in making the iPhone 13 Pro a great eco-conscious pick. Apple said it uses 54% less energy consumed than the requirements for battery charger systems. It also had a 69kg carbon footprint throughout its entire life cycle (from production to recycling), or 11% less than the iPhone 12 Pro.

**Pros**

* Apple Trade-In can give it a new life cycle once you need a new phone in a few years
* Responsible packaging
* Apple is committed to transitioning its entire manufacturing supply chain to 100% renewable electricity by 2030

**Cons**

* Expensive at $999.99-$1299.99
* A fairly heavy device at 7.19 ounces (204 grams)

## [Samsung Galaxy S22 series](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F376373%2F1036126%2F2092%3Fprodsku%3D85287695%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fsamsung-galaxy-s22-5g-unlocked-128gb-phantom-black%252F-%252FA-85287695%26intsrc%3DCATF_8031&publisher_slug=cnet&article_name=best%20green%20phone%20%282022%29&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fbest-green-phone%2F&exclusive=1&u1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp)

### Eco-conscious with a great camera

The Samsung Galaxy S22 series not only has excellent specs like a dynamic AMOLED 2x display and but it’s also dubbed as Samsung’s most eco-conscious device ever. First off, it contains 20% recycled ocean-bound plastic, all from discarded fishing nets. It also incorporates post-consumer recycled material in the speaker module and the inner parts of the volume and power keys.

The packaging is sustainable, too. Samsung says it uses 100% recycled paper for the phone’s packaging, including a protective film made from recycled plastic. It’s all a part of Samsung’s [Galaxy for the Planet](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-sustainability-vision-for-mobile-galaxy-for-the-planet) program, which includes plans to incorporate recycled material in all-new mobile products, eliminate all plastics in mobile packaging, and achieve zero waste to landfill, all by 2025.

**Pros**

* It contains 20% recycled ocean plastic
* Packaging is 100% recycled paper

**Cons**

* The phone itself could be made with a greater percentage of recycled elements
* Fairly expensive at $799.99-$1299.99

## [Fairphone 4](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/buy-fairphone-4)

### Certified sustainable

While it’s not a name-brand phone you may be familiar with, Fairphone was made to be a more sustainable option since the company was founded in 2013. Fairphone is Blue Angel certified for sustainability and is B Corp certified for using business to address social and environmental issues.

The fourth generation of the Fairphone (Fairphone 4) still has all the things you’ve come to know and love about smartphones — like a full GD+ display, dual cameras with an ultra-wide lens, and 5G speeds — while being built with sustainability in mind. The Fairphone 4 is made from aluminum from Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) certified vendors with a 100% recycled plastic back cover. And, for every phone Fairphone sells, the company recycles an equal amount of electronic waste.

One of the only downsides to the Fairphone 4 is its availability: it’s currently only available in Europe, but the company said they are hoping to expand to the US in the future possibly.

**Pros**

* Five-year warranty so your phone lasts beyond the average two-three years
* Has 5G
* Sells repair modules so you can fix the phone yourself

**Cons**

* It doesn’t ship to the US — only available in Europe
* It runs on Android 9

### Longer battery life

Lenovo (which owns Motorola) laid out an ambitious [10-year climate pledge in 2020](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/science-based-targets-initiative-for-next-generation-emission-reduction-targets/) for its sustainability plans for its products. Motorola said its [entire mobile device product range](https://www.motorola.com/us/about/corporate-responsibility-product-design) is currently free from PVC (a synthetic polymer of plastic) and BFR (mixtures of man-made chemicals). Phone batteries do not have mercury or cadmium in them. In addition, the company uses 100% recycled pulp content to replace plastic parts in its packaging.

Since all of Motorola’s phones have made this eco-conscious shift, you could choose any Motorola model, but the Motorola Edge is arguably the most impressive smartphone in the lineup. With specs like a 144Hz display, three cameras (including one with a 108MP high-resolution sensor), and up to 256GB of built-in storage, it’s a solid smartphone option. Plus, the Motorola Edge promises two days of power on a single charge, limiting the need for electricity to charge your phone every single night.

**Pros**

* Water repellent
* Efficient battery charging

**Cons**

* Camera quality doesn’t compare to competitors like Samsung or iPhone
* No wireless charging
* Disappointing software upgrade policy — phone only comes with Android 11

## What is the best green phone?

The iPhone 13 Pro is our top eco-friendly phone. We considered many specs, including eco-friendly packaging, energy consumption, incorporation of recycled materials, price, warranty, software system, camera quality, battery life and more to find the best green phone.

## What makes a phone eco-friendly?

Some of the eco-friendly aspects of a phone include recycled parts and packaging, how long a device lasts (so you don’t have to keep getting a new one every few years and contribute to the e-waste problem), a company’s carbon footprint from the phone’s production to its shipping processes, and its energy usage.

## Why choose an eco-friendly phone?

An eco-friendly phone will help reduce environmental waste (e-waste). According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), [e-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-e-waste) in America, but only a fraction of it is collected. As a result, the world produces as much as [50 million metric tons of e-waste a year](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-report-time-seize-opportunity-tackle-challenge-e-waste).

Buying an eco-friendly phone means the phone is built with recycled materials and not hazardous e-waste materials like [lead, nickel, and mercury](https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/e-waste-recycling-legislation.aspx). In addition, eco-friendly devices are built to last longer than the average smartphone, reducing the amount of e-waste by keeping your phone active for longer.

## How did we choose these eco-friendly phones?

We looked at the usual name-brand smartphones as well as the not-so-conventional brands to add to this list. We read through and fact-checked climate pledges and claims companies have made. Other criteria we considered when choosing the smartphones on this list was what the devices were made of and their overall energy usage/carbon footprint when compared to the average smartphone.

## Which eco-friendly phone is right for you?

If you’re loyal to a smartphone brand, the Apple and Samsung phones on this list are great options that don’t require you to give up the smartphone experience you are used to. If you live in Europe, the Fairphone 4 is an excellent eco-conscious option with 5G speeds. And, if you want a cheaper phone that will last you at least five years, the Teracube 2E is a great option that’s already covered by major mobile carriers.

## Are there alternative environmentally conscious phones worth considering?

Here are a couple of other phone options to look into:

[Amazon Renewed Phones](https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_arhome_2a1_w?node=17871142011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-6&pf_rd_r=4XNHDVHXAQT6VWKS4JRZ&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=ac369fbe-1701-43cd-b884-9b142d8b86d2&pf_rd_i=12653393011&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C97c0295b-70a1-4eb7-ae01-7fe836af9f2a%7Cdtp)**: Give a device a second life**

Of course, you can go the refurbished route and get any smartphone model you want and feel better about it than buying brand new. Refurbished phones are previously owned and used phones that are repaired to give them a second life. Buying refurbished means the phone won’t turn into e-waste by being thrown away to sit in a landfill. Instead, refurbished phones are sold by a mobile carrier, manufacturer, or retailer who has repaired them and runs thorough checks to ensure they meet a certain standard.

Amazon has a great pre-owned and refurbished program called Amazon Renewed that includes devices like the [iPhone](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-13-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), [Google Pixel](https://store.google.com/us/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US), [Samsung Galaxy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s22%2F&publisher_slug=zdnet&article_name=best%20green%20phone%20%282022%29&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fbest-green-phone%2F&exclusive=1&u1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), and more at lower prices than a brand new model.

# Message from Our CEO 

Dear Shareholders, Customers, Partners, and Employees, 

Samsung Electronics faced a very challenging year in 2023 due to 

macroeconomic uncertainties with high interest rates, inflation, and 

geopolitical issues as well as a sluggish memory industry and increased competition for various product lines. It is thanks to the interest and encouragement of our stakeholders that we have been able to invest 

KRW 28.3 trillion in R&D, the highest level ever, and KRW 53.1 trillion in strategic facility investments to strengthen our technology leadership, responding to mid- and long-term needs in advance, laying the 

foundation for sustainable growth even in such challenging internal and 

external environments. Once again, I would like to express my deepest 

gratitude. 

Reflecting this rapidly changing economic situation, the field of corporate sustainability is also facing many changes. In particular, information 

disclosure regarding corporate sustainability activities is entering a new era in line with the spread of global non-financial information disclosures. The International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation) issuing its sustainability disclosure standards in June 

2023, the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (U.S. SEC) subsequently confirming their climate disclosure rules all demonstrate 

the beginning of an era of mandatory ESG information disclosure. 

In addition, the EU is consistently strengthening its environmental 

regulation through means like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Bat tery Regulation. Interest in human 

rights continue to grow as well as, seen by Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, mandating supply chain human rights and work environment management, coming into effect in 2023, and the EU 

Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) being approved in May 2024 by member states. Samsung Electronics continued our efforts for a sustainable future in line with this trend. Samsung Electronics announced our New Environmental 

Strategy in September of 2022, which includes our goals to join in overcoming the global climate crisis through achieving net zero Scope 1, 2 emissions by 2050, maximizing resource circularity to contribute to a circular economy, and 

tackling environmental challenges through technological innovation. Our two divisions are pursuing a number of environmental efforts. The 

DX Division, aiming to be net zero Scope 1, 2 emissions by 2030, recorded 

a Renewable Energy (RE) transition of 93.4% by the end of 2023. This includes a 100% RE transition for our major manufacturing facilities world-

wide including the United States, EU, China, Republic of Korea, Vietnam, India, and Brazil. The DX Division is also working in line with our Resource 

Circularity Roadmap and applied recycled resin in 25% of procured plastic parts. The DS Division installed 16 new process gas treatment facilities 

(Regenerative Catalytic Systems, RCS) on 4 production line buildings to achieve net zero Scope 1, 2 emissions by 2050, and strived to reduce 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by expanding our liquid natural gas (LNG) waste heat recovery system. We proved our water management 

system’s excellence by obtaining the highest level of certification (‘Platinum’) from the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) for our Giheung, Hwaseong, Pyeongtaek (Korea) and Xi’an (China) facilities with 

the goal of reducing our water withdrawal to 2021 levels in 2030. We also aim to reduce our waste generation and are expanding the number of 

resource circularity certifications obtained from the Republic of Korea’s 

Ministry of Environment. The list current stands at 49 items including 9 

new certifications for items like wafer boxes in March of 2024. In the social sector, Samsung Electronics aligned with our Global Human 

Rights Principles (announced in February 2023) to establish a Global 

Grievance Resolution Policy in March 2024, setting up standards for our grievance submission channels’ resolution process and submitted 

grievance resolution principles. We are also expanding our supply chain work environment management scope to include non- and second-tier 

manufacturing suppliers, depending on risk analysis results. 

Samsung Elec tronics also seeks to fulfill our corporate social 

responsibility. For example, the DS Division established a standard workplace for people with disabilities, named 'Stellar Forest', as a 

subsidiary in March 2023. Stellar Forest is dedicated to providing a stable 

workplace for individuals with development disabilities, starting with 

operating a confectionary manufacturer that supplies baked goods to Samsung Electronics employees. 

This year’s Sustainability Report is organized in line with global disclosure regulation frameworks to identify our company’s key 

sustainability management issues and to faithfully communicate these 

key issues’ governance structure, strategy, implementation activities 

and current status. We also designed the Sustainability Report to closely 

connect to Samsung Electronics’ newly launched Sustainability Website. As Samsung Electronics experiences an era where environmental, social, 

and economic risks and geopolitical uncertainties have become part of 

everyday life, sustainability is an unwavering indicator of the direction 

we must take and a driving force for business competitiveness and 

technological innovations. As the saying goes, “Difficulty is the Nurse of Greatness”, and Samsung Electronics will continue to do our best to seek 

new heights through sustainability and meet the expectations of our stakeholders with even greater progress. Thank you.

## Our Company Materiality Assessment 

07 Our Company Appendix Materiality Assessment Facts & Figures Principle Planet People Samsung Electronics Sustainability Report 2024 08 Our Company Appendix Materiality Assessment Facts & Figures Principle Planet People Samsung Electronics Sustainability Report 2024 

Samsung Electronics conducts materiality assessments identifying 

and prioritizing key sustainability issues material to our business, transparently disclosing the processes and results. In 2024, We 

conducted a Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) adapted from the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group‘s (EFRAG) materiality assessment implementation guidance. 

DMA Definition 

Samsung Electronics' 2024 DMA evaluates topics of potential materiality to Samsung Electronics’ sustainability, considering both relevant company activities’ impacts to the external environment and relevant external factors’ financial impacts to the company in order to ascertain material topics for Samsung Electronics’ sustainable management. 

DMA Process 

Samsung Elec tronic s’ DMA process consist s of four steps: ①

understanding the business, ② identifying impacts, risks, and opportunities (IROs), ③ evaluating IROs, and ④ selecting material topics. 

Step 1. Understanding the Business 

Understanding the business involved analyzing our business’ internal/ external environments and value chain, then identifying primary topics. In the internal/external environment analysis, we reviewed disclosed 

company data such as our Annual Business Report and internal company data such as stakeholder inquiries to secure base materials for future evaluation processes. We also conducted a value chain analysis to derive ESG topics that comprehensively consider relevant stakeholder characteristics within 

the value chain. We first organized the value chain into ‘upstream (raw materials, parts, and other suppliers) – own operations (manufacturing, sales) – downstream (transportation, sales, repairs/services)’ phases and identified each phase’s key stakeholders’ industrial sectors and 

business activities. We then analyzed ESG topics for each industrial sector referencing the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 

standards, after which we derived material ESG topics for each Division and Business Unit’s individual value chain phases. We also identified key stakeholder groups interested in our sustainability 

activities in order to widely gather stakeholder opinions during the assessment process. We also established various opinion gathering 

plans to accommodate our diverse stakeholders’ characteristics. 

Reflecting DX/DS Divisional Characteristics Samsung Electronics 

strived to reflect our Divisional characteristics during the DMA process. In the value chain analysis step we identified individual value chains by DX, DS Divisions and their respective Business Units to comprehensively 

consider sector-specific ESG topics in issue pool composition and 

assessment. We also identified and performed surveys/interviews with Division specific employees, customers, and suppliers while evaluating 

stakeholder groups. 

[Derive Primary Topics] 

Samsung Electronics formed an issue pool of 115 issues, constructed 

from 92 sub-topics as suggested by the European Sustainability 

Reporting Standards (ESRS) and 23 additional, sector specific issues. 

Each issue was evaluated against four criteria (alignment with company 

strategy, alignment with global initiatives, key issues in the industry, and results of value chain analysis) to derive 52 issues, and 13 primary 

topics were selected to encompass these 52 issues based on the topic taxonomy of the ESRS.

Dell Technologies is advancing sustainable laptop production to minimise environmental impact, ensuring a more eco-conscious use of finite minerals

Over a six-year period, laptops on average produce between 691kg - 928 kg of CO₂ emissions, according to Oxford University.

Laptops are replaced more frequently than desktops, with an average life cycle of four years.

The majority of emissions stem from manufacturing and shipping, while 15% come from electricity consumption during use.

The manufacturing of laptops demands substantial water consumption and the extraction of [raw materials](https://manufacturingdigital.com/articles/procurement-teams-manage-raw-materials-costs), leading to a considerable environmental impact.

Understanding the urgency to address these challenges, companies like [Dell](https://manufacturingdigital.com/technology/new-ai-labs-dell-td-synnex-to-power-europe-ai-innovation) are taking substantial measures to diminish their ecological footprint.

## The importance of resource-conscious laptop production

Organisations like WWF emphasise that the planet can only sustain a limited amount of greenhouse gases while maintaining its health.

As production increases, the adverse effects of overconsumption become significant.

Karen Ellis, Chief Economist at WWF, underscores this urgency, noting: “We are living in a time when human impacts on the environment are changing the face of our planet.

“I believe that finding ways to ensure that we as a global society live sustainably is the top priority if we are to ensure that nature, the species we love so much and we ourselves are able to live in harmony on this planet.

""We are working hard both in the UK and together with our partners in countries all over the world, to find ways to do this, to identify more sustainable patterns of development, and to promote more sustainable management of our natural resources.”

## IT companies' role in promoting sustainability

Dell Technologies is prioritising s[ustainability across its manufacturing processes](https://manufacturingdigital.com/articles/how-philips-is-embedding-sustainability-in-healthcare).

Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, says: “Sustainability and ESG commitments are now widely recognised as business imperatives that impact everything from supplier decisions to business strategy.

“At Dell, we are both meeting our goals and helping customers meet theirs.""

In conjunction with these aims, Dell incorporated 43.1 million kg of reused, renewable or recycled materials into its products in 2024, with 96.4% of packaging being made from recycled or renewable substances.

Dell's sustainability objectives include a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and sourcing 100% of electricity from renewable sources by 2040.

## Innovations in sustainable manufacturing

Dell is also exploring the circular economy model, emphasising repair, recovery and reuse instead of creating new products from scratch.

Through initiatives like Concept Luna, which introduced the world's first modular USB-C port, Dell enhances product durability and repairability.

Furthermore, Dell provides resources to customers, like troubleshooting and repair guides, to help extend the life cycle of its devices.

Maria Mohr, Sustainability Lead for the Global Presales Technical Community at Dell, says: “Sustainability has always been integral to how we operate — woven into our processes, products and the ways we help customers achieve their goals.

""By connecting robust internal operations with impactful customer solutions, we bring sustainability to every step of the process, fostering progress for businesses and the planet.""

By focusing on sustainability in its products and processes, Dell is setting an example in the industry, showcasing how manufacturers can contribute to a more sustainable future.

On June 28, Samsung Electronics released the 2024 edition of its Sustainability Report.

Samsung continues to disclose the results of materiality assessments focused on sustainable management that consider both the impacts of corporate activities on the external environment and external factors on the company. This report contains Samsung’s strategies and major achievements related to the environment, social and governance.

### **[Environment]****Climate Change and Energy │ Resource Circularity and Waste │ Water**

In September 2022, Samsung announced its New Environmental Strategy which includes the company’s goals to achieve net zero Scope 1,2 emissions by 2050, maximize resource circularity to contribute to a circular economy and tackle environmental challenges through technological innovation.

Samsung’s Device eXperience (DX) division aims to reach net zero Scope 1,2 emissions by 2030. The DX division achieved 93.4% renewable energy conversion as of the end of 2023 — which includes 100% renewable energy used at major global manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe, Korea, China, Brazil, India and Vietnam.

In line with the company’s Resource Circularity Roadmap, recycled resin was incorporated in 25% of procured plastic parts purchased last year. Moreover, the DX division expanded its electronic waste (e-waste) recovery and recycling programs to more than 70 countries as of the end of 2023.

Samsung’s Device Solutions (DS) division installed new process gas treatment facilities (regenerative catalytic systems, RCS) and expanded the use of liquid natural gas (LNG) waste heat recovery systems in 2023 to help reach net zero Scope 1,2 emissions by 2050. As a result of various reduction activities, the DS division’s Scope 1,2 emissions decreased by 11.6% in 2023 compared to 2022. Additionally, the DS Division ha s expand ed its renewable energy use by signing p ower p urchase a greement s (PPA s) in Korea to supply renewable energy from a 60-megawatt solar power plant.

Proving the excellence of its water management system s,Samsung obtained Platinum certification —the highest level —from the Alliance for Water Stewardship(AWS) for its Giheung, Hwaseong and Pyeongtaek facilities in Korea and its Xi’an facility in China. Furthermore, t he company is reducing wast e generation by expanding the number of resource circularity certifications obtained from Korea’s Ministry of Environment to include certifications for nine new items as of March 2024.

### [Social and G overnance]

Employees│ Supply Chain │ Information Security and Protection │ Product Quality and Safety │Business Conduct

Samsung is upholding human rights and improv ing working environments while striving to create a strong corporate culture for executives and employees. The Global Grievance Resolution Policy was enacted in April 2024 to ensure grievances received are fairly and consistently handled per the company’s Global Human Rights Principles. With a goal of increasing the number of women in the workforce, Samsung plans to more than double the baseline number of women executives by 2030 as compared to 2022.

Continuing its support for employees with disabilities, Samsung opened a subsidiary standard workplace in 2023 called “Stellar Forest” to create sustainable jobs for people with developmental disabilities. Starting with a confectionary manufacturer that supplies baked goods to Samsung employees, Stellar Forest plans to diversify into additional industries to create more job opportunities fit for those with disabilities.

Samsung is gradually expanding its supply chain management scope to include second-tier and non-manufacturing suppliers. Third-party audits were introduced to select second-tier suppliers in 2023, extending the Supplier Code of Conduct from manufacturing suppliers to all suppliers that provide products and services to Samsung.

Furthermore, the company expanded its security platform Samsung Knox to cover not only smartphones but also smart TVs and smart home appliances. With regular security updates of Galaxy mobile devices, Samsung extended the support period for security updates up to seven years starting from January 2024.

Samsung prioritizes personal information protection, product quality, customer safety, compliance and ethical management across the company.

Part of an aspirational workstream led by our design engineers that asks the “what if” questions, Concept Luna provides the freedom and flexibility to test innovative ideas outside of regular design cycles.
Innovation inspired by Concept Luna Although initially designed for exploratory purposes rather than commercialization, the innovations stemming from Concept Luna have ultimately led to innovations in our product portfolio. For example, low emissions aluminum was originally part of Concept Luna, and transitioned from a concept to applied use on XPS, Latitude laptops and Precision mobile workstations. This mix of hydropower-produced and recycled aluminum reduces the emissions of the material by 90% over coal power production.
The 100% hydropower achieved a 70% carbon footprint reduction compared to coal.

Sustainable materials We are investing in sustainable materials to reach our goals. By 2030, 100% of our packaging and more than 50% of our product content will be made from recycled or renewable materials.
Bio-Based Plastic Castor beans, tall oil and POM Eco B are naturally-replenishing alternatives to plastic.
Paper Fibers Our packaging is created from bamboo, recycled paper pulp, and sugarcane fibers.
Recycled Glass We are using recycled glass as an alternative to traditional glass; conserving resources and reducing waste.
Closed-Loop Materials Recovered e-waste is used to make parts for new devices and keeps components in the circular economy.
Post-Consumer Recycled Plastic Post-consumer recycled plastic allows us to reuse existing materials, decreasing our need for new plastic.
Reclaimed Carbon Fiber Carbon fiber reclaimed from the aerospace and other industries is recycled for use in our laptops.
Recycled Ocean-Bound Plastic We’ve saved over 443,000 pounds of plastics from the ocean, recycling them for use in our products and packaging.6 8 | Dell sustainable products & solutions © 2024 Dell Inc. or its subsidiaries.
Recycled Metal Using recycled metal reduces our dependence on mining and processing new materials.
Recycled Cobalt We are estimated to ship 21 million laptops accounting to nearly 500MT of recycled cobalt in PC batteries. All without compromising the performance of our PCs.
Sustainable Aluminum Our products feature sustainable aluminum sourced from low-emissions, low-carbon, and recycled materials. Our use of hydropower-produced aluminum reduces carbon emissions by 70% compared to coal powered production.7 Recycled Copper We are using recycled copper in more than 1 million power cables with a goal to impact more than 20 million over the next few years.
Recycled Steel World’s first desktop PC designed with 50% recycled steel in the chassis.
Recycled Magnesium Recycling magnesium involves melting down and reusing existing magnesium product or scraps – a much more energy-efficient process than the extraction of primary magnesium from raw ore.

Responsible packaging As a leader in responsible packaging, we strive to reduce waste and drive innovation to find recycled and renewable alternatives that protect our products while in transit. We aim to deliver all our products in packaging made from 100% recycled or renewable materials by 2030.
Sustainable Packaging Our packaging is designed to maximize its recycling potential by using recycled and renewable materials. From PC devices, displays, and peripherals, to servers, storage, and networking — we design and package our products using recycled or renewable materials where possible.
We have packaging made from 100% recycled or renewable material on all new Dell notebooks our commercial notebooks.8 Multipack Solutions Simplified Unboxing: To save time when deploying and installing new equipment, shipping multiple products in a single package reduces the time it takes to unbox and clean up packaging materials.
Easier to Manage, Less to Organize: Multipack increases the number of products on each pallet resulting in significant space savings with less packages to account for in planning and organization.

Sustainable solutions sought as populations expand and resources diminish.
Pope Francis, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, music producer Will.i.am and round-the-world yachtswoman Dame Ellen MacArthur. Just a small selection of big names promoting the circular economy and issues surrounding sustainability and recycling.
Television, radio and the printed press are featuring more and more stories with quotes from high-level, high-profile leaders speaking about the future of the planet.
Big business, government and corporations are concerned about the impact of energy use – and its ever-increasing cost – and these concerns are driving the circular economy up the economic and political agendas. People are beginning to sit up and take notice.
Addressing the powerful insurers of Lloyd’s of London in The City, Bank of England Governor Carney said: ‘Research tells us with a high degree of confidence that in the northern hemisphere, the last 30 years have been the warmest since Anglo-Saxon times. Indeed, eight of the 10 warmest years on record in the UK have occurred since 2002.
‘Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are at levels not seen in 800,000 years and the rate of sea level rise is quicker now than at any time over the last two millennia,’ he said. ‘Evidence is mounting of man’s role in climate change. Human drivers are judged extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century,’ he added.
‘Our societies face a series of profound environmental and social challenges.
‘The combination of the weight of scientific evidence and the dynamics of the financial system suggest that, in the fullness of time, climate change will threaten financial resilience and longer-term prosperity.
‘While there is still time to act, the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking.
‘Others will need to learn from Lloyd’s example in combining data, technology and expert judgment to measure and manage risks,’ he said.
The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference – to be held in Paris from November 30 to December 11 – will work towards plans to curb carbon emissions and encourage the funding of new technologies,’ said Mr Carney. ‘We will need the market to work alongside in order to maximise their impact.
‘With better information as a foundation, we can build a virtuous circle of better understanding of tomorrow’s risks, better pricing for investors, better decisions by policymakers, and a smoother transition to a lower-carbon economy.
The Pope is another key stakeholder for the circular economy, pushing it up the agenda. ‘The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth’ is just one of 63 tweets by Pope Francis on climate change. ‘What kind of world do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up?’ was another. ‘Climate change should be the thing that we are all worried and concerned about as humans on this planet, how we affect the planet, our consumption, and how we treat the place that we live in.’ Those words are from former Black Eyed Peas front man Will.i.am, addressing the Oxford Union on climate change, a subject he has also written songs about.
Will.i.am already runs a non-profit organisation aiming to improve the lives of children by ‘providing education, opportunity and inspiration’.
His circular economy interests include laptops, robots and mobile phones, especially the cameras they use.
Celebrity endorsement, backed by foundations and innovations, is clearly beneficial to the campaign for a circular economy. The rising number of such influential people is helping local people and organisations make a global impact on energy consumption and climate change.
Circular Economy spiralling up the agenda.
Welcome to The Circular Economist.
‘Who are circular economists?’ you may well ask. They are the future-ready decision makers looking to create a world of positive change in business practices to sustain the earth and everything in it, and on it, for future generations. They are people who recognise that if we fail to prepare – we prepare to fail.
In these pages you will find a snapshot of current initiatives towards a circular economy. These are initiatives that aim to replace a linear ‘take, make, dispose’ economic model that relies on large quantities of cheap, easily accessible materials and energy; with a model that is restorative and regenerative by design, and aims to keep products, components, and materials at the highest levels of utilisation and maximise their value at all times.
The circular economy is an essential component of Dell’s company vision. Dell believes that technology plays a vital role in the transition to a circular economy, and this is embodied in our purpose; to deliver technology solutions that help people everywhere to grow and thrive.
You will see in these pages the social, economic and environmental potential of adopting future-ready technology such as desktop virtualization. You will also learn about Dame Ellen MacArthur’s Circular Economy 100 programme, a worldwide alliance of companies focusing on commercial opportunities from circular economy initiatives. We also feature Repair Cafés, an initiative to reduce marine litter, and end with a profile on the company that printed this publication – which is made from 100% recycled paper. You will hear a common theme, with many voices asking the current generation of business leaders to think about their legacy, and to make it a legacy of good. The good news is that this can be achieved while at the same time creating a future-ready workforce: flexible, mobile and secure, with reduced power consumption and operating costs.
It’s time to think big. It’s time to act. It’s time to be a circular economist.
David Angwin Marketing Director, Dell Cloud Client-Computing.
Dell was recently incorporated into the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Economy 100 – an innovation programme established to enable organisations from across the economy to develop new opportunities and realise their circular economy ambitions faster.

As well as dealing with the environmental, social and economic problems caused by more and more people moving into cities, they are having to find and develop new sustainable solutions to the problems caused by the influx.
‘Sustainable’ is the key word there. Sustainable energy, water, methods of production, storage and distribution, transport, housing and – most importantly – waste management. Using energy more efficiently; reducing costs; lowering carbon footprint; and improving working environments are all on the ‘To Do’ list of those in charge.
Populations are expanding, resources are diminishing and today’s linear economic model is running out of time. This is dawning on producers of goods and services as well as those using those goods and services.
The circular economy message is hitting home with people who count – and who we count on – to bring about necessary changes in thinking, purchasing, using and recycling.
‘Post-2008, the concept of green growth has gained international support among policy makers as a means of reconciling the ongoing need for economic growth set within environmental limits,’ said Professor Martin Charter, Director of the Centre for Sustainable Design at the University for the Creative Arts.
‘This thinking has now filtered down into a range of national, regional, and city government initiatives as illustrated in the recent report by the Global Green Growth Institute,’ said Professor Charter.
Cities – where 70 percent of the world’s population will live by 2050 (according to UN World Urbanisation Prospects) – face major climate change impacts. ‘Climate change is moving back into the spotlight. In September 2014, there were major demonstrations in New York and London over the need for action over climate change in parallel to United Nations Climate Change Summit in New York,’ he said. Hollywood movie actor and environmental activist Leonardo Di Caprio was appointed the United Nations Messenger of Peace. He spoke on climate change to raise its media profile in the lead-up to the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris. Is the circular economy at a turning point? ‘Some cities may embrace the change and transform (for example Copenhagen); and some may react or rebel against it. If we are to achieve more resilient, resource efficient, low carbon economies and societies, we will need to break away from conventional ways of doing things to the creation of new models of – for example – consumption and production,’ said Professor Charter.
For cities to get smarter, those at the top and those at the bottom need to be drivers of change. ‘Smart cities are a techno-centric concept, and a key issue will be how we move beyond technological discussions to explore how civil society and citizens can engage and involve themselves in the process of making cities smarter, more sustainable, and importantly, livable,’ said Professor Charter.
Only then can city dwellers benefit from those big decisions being made correctly.
T urning point for ‘smart cities’ on circular economy thinking.
Lights out: Street lamps in Amsterdam have been upgraded to allow municipal councils to dim the lights based on pedestrian usage. One of the loudest voices shouting through the fog surrounding the circular economy right now is round-the-world yachtswoman Dame Ellen MacArthur. The 39-year-old retired sailor, who lives in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, set up her charitable foundation in 2010. She works tirelessly to get the circular economy turning ever-more quickly.
Dame Ellen’s work with founding partners B&Q, BT/Cisco, National Grid and Renault has triggered many circular economy initiatives looking at more than $1 billion in resource savings and new revenues.
‘Ellen MacArthur’s involvement, particularly focused on the circular economy, has been the most explosive growth by any environmental organisation in 25 years,’ said Professor Martin Charter, Director of The Centre for Sustainable Design.
‘She’s got into a lot of boardrooms doing talks about leadership, boardrooms where lots of CEOs are yachting people so they love her. ‘She is seeing all the right people and she is so forensic. She has a team of about 30 people and knowledge partners who gain high-level accessibility, big meetings. They have acquired a credibility within the business community.
‘They are hugely influential in this debate,’ said Professor Charter.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation Circular Economy 100 programme is a worldwide alliance of companies focusing on commercial opportunities from circular economy initiatives. Dell has joined the program and will work with global business leaders to develop new approaches as to how companies manufacture goods. Dell also aims to identify new partnership opportunities and contribute best practices that help businesses and society accelerate the shift to a circular economy.
Since 2013, Dell has incorporated more than 21 million pounds of recycled plastics from sources including water bottles and CD cases as it continues to work towards a goal of using 50 million pounds of recycled materials by 2020.
Bringing about the circular economy may not be plain sailing, but Ellen MacArthur’s message is racing around the world just as fast as she used to sail around it in her yacht. Only this time, she’s not alone.

The collective efforts of his employees earned Dell the Accenture Circular Economy Pioneer Award, the Keep America Beautiful Vision for America Award and ISRI’s (Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries) Design for Recycling Award. Dell was also listed among the world’s most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute.
‘As we prepare for a future with 9.6 billion people in it, it’s imperative that we take a good, hard look at the impact we individually and collectively have on the earth we share,’ says Dell in his company’s 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
‘We’re proud of the efforts we’ve made and truly inspired by what’s possible in the years ahead.’ ‘Yes, 9.6 billion people sharing the planet is daunting, but technology – the very thing we live and breathe here at Dell – is a big part of the solution.

Find freedom with the office of the future.
The office as you know it is history. Replaced by coffee bars, airport lounges and workers’ homes. Staff are being set free from the chains of their office, so to speak, into a world where they can access their data safely and securely wherever they might be.
Enabling this level of flexibility while maintaining security is not without its challenges.
Dell cloud client-computing uses client virtualization technology to enable this increasingly mobile environment by offering secure, reliable access to applications and content any time, anywhere, on any device.
Learn more here: bitly.com/dell-office Taking off: Today’s working environment is increasingly mobile with people demanding secure, reliable access to apps and content.
Ensuring employees can be as productive as possible in today’s highly mobile environment, with an ever increasing range of devices, many of which are employee owned, creates challenges for organisations who have previously only had to deal with fixed desktops, mobile workers with laptops, and corporate owned mobile phones.
The good news is that there is an existing, mature technology that addresses these challenges while also reducing power consumption and maximising useful service life – which are both key to achieving a circular economy. This technology is known as client or desktop virtualization.
Desktop virtualization is not new. It’s been around a long time, been called many different names and is widely adopted. Dell cloud client-computing uses the latest developments in converged infrastructure, cloud computing and client devices to deliver desktop virtualization benefits to customers around the world. Let’s take a look at some of this technology’s benefits in more detail: Improved security Data on devices at the edge of the network will always be harder to secure than data maintained on centralised servers. By moving data to the centre – in a private, hybrid or public cloud – cloud client-computing simplifies data security and management and makes compliance with regulatory requirements far easier. Using virus-immune thin clients at the desktop further strengthens security for end-user computing.
Cloud client-computing also simplifies security for user-owned devices (BYOD) by providing secure access while never putting data on the device.
Reduced energy usage Virtualization has been used for many years in the datacentre to improve resource utilisation and achieve significant reductions in power usage. Cloud client-computing uses the same approach for end-user computing by moving most of the compute power to the datacentre. This enables available compute resource to be shared across many users and much higher levels of resource utilisation to be achieved.
By combining this with energy efficient thin clients on the desk, which use up to 90% less power than a dedicated PC, a well-designed implementation will result in significant power savings even when increased power requirements in the datacentre are taken into account.
Extended service life Thin clients have no moving parts. With data residing in the datacentre a spinning disk for local storage is not required, and convection cooling means no fan. As a result they are highly reliable and can achieve a service life of 5-10 years. This reduces desktop refresh cycles and the resources needed for new hardware. Simplified management Centralising desktop and application management combined with less complexity at the edge of the network can have a big impact on management and desktop support workloads. Application deployment that would have previously taken days or weeks, can be achieved in minutes or hours. With cloud client-computing, organisations will often deploy an application upgrade out-of-hours so that when users login the following day everybody has the new application available with no loss of productive working time.
Centralised management and less complex devices on the desk means that deskside support visits can often be eliminated; reducing costs and getting the user productive again more quickly.
Flexible and mobile People work better where they’re most effective. That could be at home, remotely, at a customer’s address, beside a patient or out in the field. Cloud client-computing environments enable this to happen fast and effectively, boosting workforce satisfaction, reducing unnecessary travel and its environmental impact, and delivering a more sustainable customer service model.
Future Ready The lower cost per computing ‘seat’ versus traditional desktop computing models means that more ‘seats’ can be deployed for the same budget, more quickly and more affordably than before. That’s more computing power in the hands of a growing workforce for less investment, making them Future Ready for the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.

‘Dell has made great progress across its global business ecosystem in its efforts to use the technology we produce for good,’ said Trisa Thompson, vice president of corporate responsibility at Dell.
‘We’re committed to this ongoing work and share our results to both create and inspire positive change in business practices’, she said

One of the first steps toward a more sustainable future in the electronics sector is designing products with environmental impacts in mind. This can be done in many different ways, but efficiency will be the foundation for it all. Energy efficiency must take precedence in manufacturing and production, and material efficiency must become a requirement for product design. By doing so, we will not only reduce overall environmental degradation, but we can sustainably source materials without depleting resources. At the same time, eco-friendly materials will help curb pollution when e-waste is improperly managed - which presents a severe risk to the environment and its ecosystems.

# The Future of Sustainable Electronics

![The Future of Sustainable Electronics](//myteracube.com/cdn/shop/articles/unnamed-28_91109dfd-7143-46d1-839c-1624664d9da0_533x.jpg?v=1738635374)

The global demand for sustainability across all industries is growing at an all-time high, and it’s far from slowing down. This rings particularly true for the electronics industry, but it’s a brand new stomping ground for manufacturers and consumers alike. [According to a study conducted by the United Nations University](https://unu.edu/news/news/with-e-waste-predicted-to-double-by-2050-business-as-usual-is-not-an-option.html), we will have doubled our use and consumption of electronics by 2050, creating a sharp rise in the amount of manufacturing needed to keep up. If significant changes are not made to suppress the environmental impacts of electronics manufacturing and improper e-waste management, we could be facing a problem unseen before now. In the current prediction model, the amount of e-waste produced over the next 30 years will increase to over 110 million tons per year. The good news is that there is light on the horizon, with new technologies advancing our production and material sourcing that should help minimize the adverse effects seen until now. 

## **Eco-Friendly Designs**

One of the first steps toward a more sustainable future in the electronics sector is designing products with environmental impacts in mind. This can be done in many different ways, but efficiency will be the foundation for it all. Energy efficiency must take precedence in manufacturing and production, and material efficiency must become a requirement for product design. By doing so, we will not only reduce overall environmental degradation, but we can sustainably source materials without depleting resources. At the same time, eco-friendly materials will help curb pollution when e-waste is improperly managed - [which presents a severe risk to the environment and its ecosystems.](https://www.ewaste1.com/how-does-recycling-electronics-help-the-environment/) 

## **Sourcing Sustainable Raw Materials**

With e-waste pollution on the rise, it’s more important than ever that brands and manufacturers begin to sustainably source raw materials that will help prevent or reduce further destruction to the environment. Currently, electronic devices are manufactured with materials like mercury, lead, cadmium, and lithium, [all of which wreak havoc on soil, air, and water resources](https://elytus.com/blog/e-waste-and-its-negative-effects-on-the-environment.html) once they enter natural systems. Recent research has confirmed that many alternative materials can be used in place of these, including aluminum, borosilicate glass, iron alloy, and graphene. Not only will sourcing these raw materials to manufacture electronics reduce the amount of environmental degradation due to e-waste, [but it will save time, money, and energy throughout the production process.](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/alternative-energy/top-five-green-materials-for-electronics) 

## **Energy Efficient Manufacturing**

As stated earlier, energy efficiency in production is pivotal in moving toward a sustainable future in the electronics industry. While rising energy costs are a good incentive for companies to increase efficiency throughout production, the benefits seen from this would stretch to consumers and industry giants alike. Governments around the globe have begun incentivizing energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse emissions, so we are on the right track to make a positive impact on a global scale. Still, we as consumers must do our part in demanding green manufacturing for the products that are so intertwined in our lives. 

Renewable energy will also continue to receive funding and support, furthering environmental health and the fight against climate change. Wind and solar power are two of the leading green energy sources worldwide, [with offshore wind energy production increasing by 16% in 2020 alone](https://yearbook.enerdata.net/renewables/wind-solar-share-electricity-production.html). Renewable energy production even continued to rise throughout the global COVID-19 pandemic, showing just how much opportunity there is in the renewable sector. If we can continue to utilize renewable energy in electronics manufacturing, companies will have no choice but to step further into a more sustainable future. 

## **Improved Lifecycle Management**

[The lifecycle of electronics](https://www.epa.gov/smm-electronics/basic-information-about-electronics-stewardship#02) can be laid out pretty straightforwardly, but it’s not always as simple as it may appear on paper. For a better understanding, the general lifecycle of electronics is as follows:

While there is never one consistent roadmap for a particular product, better lifecycle management can be implemented to increase the likelihood of electronics being reused, refurbished, or recycled. As a consumer, the best way to help is to actively seek out avenues in which you can donate or recycle your used electronics. You can also buy green electronics (those that are sustainably manufactured) to reduce the environmental impact of products that end up where they shouldn’t. 

## **Teracube’s Commitment to Sustainable Electronics**

[Teracube](https://myteracube.com/) is proud to be a pioneer in sustainable electronics, pushing the envelope and setting a standard for other companies to follow. We recognize that the most detrimental impacts of electronics come from manufacturing process and improper e-waste management, so we designed a line of smartphones manufactured with some green materials that have a lifespan that far exceeds our competitors. All of our phones are backed by a full manufacturer warranty, giving you the confidence you need to make a responsible purchase that contributes to a sustainable future of electronics. We also manufacture our products in a way that allows you to repair and replace individual components, reducing the overall amount of e-waste that ends up in landfills. We are big supporters of the [Right to Repair](https://www.repair.org/stand-up), a movement taking aim at big tech companies that limit the options of consumers to repair their electronics, creating excess e-waste and adversely impacting the environment for the sake of a dollar. As a bonus, Teracube will plant a tree for every device sold - helping to offset our carbon footprint, as small as it may be.

## The History of Fairphone

Fairphone was founded in 2013 by Bas van Abel, a Dutch social entrepreneur. The idea for Fairphone came to Bas Van Abel while he was working on a project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

He was struck by the prevalence of conflict minerals, which are used in the production of electronics, and the devastating impact they had on local communities.

This experience led him to explore ways to create a more ethical and sustainable smartphone.

The first Fairphone was launched in 2013, and it was designed to be a smartphone that was not only environmentally friendly but also socially responsible.

The company aimed to create a phone that would last longer, be easier to repair, and use fair trade and conflict-free materials.

For many years, companies operated their global supply chains on the assumption that minimizing cost was synonymous with competitiveness. But five years of cascading disruptions—including a pandemic, climate shocks, and dramatic shifts in trade policies—have shattered that logic and prompted companies to focus on making their supply chains more resilient, even if doing so means taking on higher costs and greater complexity.

Now, a new imperative faces companies: to make their supply chains resilient in a financially sustainable way. We call this new operating model the ""cost of resilience” mindset. It’s about striking the right balance between cost competitiveness and agility—building manufacturing and sourcing networks that can flex in the face of disruption without eroding margin or market share.

Four megatrends are accelerating and shaping this transition: the rise of economic statecraft, heightening climate risk, wider adoption of robotics, and intensifying competition for manufacturing and supply chain talent.

Companies across a range of industrial sectors are responding to the challenge with various strategies. For example, in place of single, world-spanning supply chains that serve all markets, they are developing multiple regional—and in some cases local—supply chains. They are introducing additional redundancy to their sourcing networks, directly or through supply chain brokers—intermediaries that can shift sourcing within their own global networks. At the same time, they are searching for new ways to achieve scale, such as by pooling their capital investments in joint ventures or by working with contract manufacturers.

Successfully achieving resilience and cost efficiency in this unpredictable era entails gaining new capabilities and incorporating a greater range of factors into strategic decision making. Most companies will need to upgrade their ability to anticipate and manage geopolitical risks. To accomplish this, they should accelerate their adoption of advanced robotics in both high-cost economies and emerging markets, factor in risks associated with [climate change](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/climate-change-sustainability/overview) and natural disasters, and focus more on securing blue-collar, white-collar, and digital talent.

## Behind the Shift to a Cost-of-Resilience Mindset

For decades, ""cost is king"" was the mantra of global [supply-chain management](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/operations/supply-chain-management). Efficiency, consolidation, large scale, and just-in-time delivery reigned. Manufacturers in many sectors shifted production from high-cost economies to nations where labor, land, and other essentials cost less, under terms negotiated in multilateral trade deals and mediated by the World Trade Organization. To achieve economies of scale, companies typically concentrated production in a few massive factories in countries such as China, which emerged as the workshop of the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the disadvantages of overconcentration and the cost-is-king mindset. Factory shutdowns in China and elsewhere abruptly halted flows of goods and critical components, resulting in shortages, stranded assets, soaring prices, and lost market share.

“Resilience at all costs” became the new creed. The older obsessions with leanness and efficiencies of scale gave way to a focus on building more globally dispersed supply chains closer to end markets, adding redundancy, and keeping more inventory. Efforts by companies to reshore some production to North America, supported by US incentives and trade policies, greatly accelerated. For example, foreign auto companies in the electric vehicle (EV) segment invested more than $35 billion in the US from 2021 through 2024.

Many companies, however, soon found that resilience at all costs was financially unsustainable. Sharp US [tariff](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/international-business/navigating-international-trade/what-is-a-tariff?utm_source=search&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=geopolitics&utm_description=paid&utm_topic=tariffs&utm_geo=global&utm_content=dsa_explainer&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22423918029&gbraid=0AAAAACKyBhoBDCGFNAOjS54tpf13xHBAR&gclid=CjwKCAjwvO7CBhAqEiwA9q2YJZRkyKZtnG1f1c9syztk4ZhiGbWPBj3WvQ8juUO9SzTGr2c4Ny9MnRoC3joQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) increases on goods from nations that had benefited from relatively free trade have been the tipping point. BCG estimates that at least 20% to 30% of EBIT margins for companies across all [manufacturing](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/manufacturing/overview) sectors are at risk from higher tariffs. At the same time, geopolitical tensions and frequently shifting trade policies mean that maintaining resilience remains important.

Four megatrends will exert pressure on companies to find a better balance between cost and resilience:

Expand All

Megatrend 1: The Rise of Economic Statecraft

Governments worldwide are turning to [economic statecraft](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/economic-statecraft-is-back) to support their domestic industries and advance their foreign policy agendas. They are competing for and screening inbound and outbound foreign direct investment and deploying novel tools, such as newly established sovereign wealth funds, to achieve strategic goals. They are also adopting measures normally taken to counter allegedly unfair trade practices.  
  
The expanding scale and scope of tariffs are the clearest manifestations of the trend. For example, on April 2, 2025, the US introduced a 10% baseline tariff on goods from all nations and additional tariffs of up to 50% on imports from dozens of countries. At one point, US tariffs on Chinese goods reached 145% before the US government paused them for 90 days. China, Canada, the EU, and other trading partners subsequently retaliated or have prepared to do so. The flow of exports from China to the US sharply contracted. As of this writing, many of these tariff increases are being litigated in courts and remain the subject of negotiations between the US and its trading partners.  
  
The US tariffs will have a material impact on OEMs and their suppliers because they affect goods shipped to the US, imported components used in US manufacturing, and goods shipped to other nations that are subject to retaliatory tariffs.  
  
Risk exposure is closely tied to manufacturers’ dependence on the US market for sales and on China for supplies. The impact on automakers and their supply chains is particularly pronounced. US OEMs that rely on China for a significant portion of their parts sourcing, for instance, could see a 5- to 7-percentage-point drop in their margins—a decline of up to 75%. Percentage-point drops in margins would reach double digits across the full supply chain serving those OEMs. In contrast, for OEMs with more global supply chains the risk to EBIT margins is 1 to 3 percentage points, while for their supply chains the risk is 6 to 7 percentage points. (See the exhibit.)  
  
Policymakers also employ other economic statecraft tools to transform supply chains. Nations are offering giga-incentives—typically involving more than $5 billion—to promote high-priority domestic industries. Such incentives have driven an eightfold increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in US semiconductor manufacturing over the past four years, compared with 2017 through 2020, and a sixtyfold FDI increase in Poland’s semiconductor sector. Nations are forming alliances to accelerate development of strategic sectors such as critical minerals and lithium-ion batteries. They are also taking more defensive actions in key sectors. For example, citing national security concerns, policymakers in the US, China, and South Korea are screening inbound and outbound FDI in sectors such as AI, chips, and quantum computing.

Megatrend 2: Climate-Related Events as Strategic Risks 

Although some public and private stakeholders are deprioritizing environmental sustainability, the need to adapt to and mitigate the impact of extreme weather and rising sea levels continues to reshape global business. For instance, floods, intense heatwaves, and other events driven by climate change are already disrupting manufacturing operations and logistics infrastructure.  
  
A BCG assessment found that 19 of the world’s 30 top ports, representing 35% of global throughput, face high risk from extreme weather and rising sea levels. Most of these ports are in Asia-Pacific. The port in Shenzhen, China, which handles around 30 million 20-foot equivalent tons of cargo annually, is most exposed to flooding and storms. Major ports in Europe and North America are relatively less exposed.  
  
We studied the world’s 50 biggest manufacturing hubs for a range of sectors and concluded that climate-related events threaten around 8% of their output. East Asia is home to 10 of the 3 highest-risk sites. (See the exhibit.) In several of them, 20% of output and 10% of capital investment are at risk. Consumer electronic manufacturing is the most vulnerable sector, with 6 of 13 major hubs at high risk. Manufacturing hubs in Malaysia and Taiwan that account for around 40% of semiconductor production are also highly exposed to extreme weather and rising sea levels. Medtech manufacturing, by contrast, is among the most resilient sectors, mainly because eight of the top ten hubs are in low-risk locations such as Zurich, Boston, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and because of the industry’s low-volume, high-precision, geographically distributed production model.

Megatrend 3: Mounting Manufacturing Talent Bottlenecks

Demographic shifts, changing skill requirements, and politically driven policies are exacerbating global shortages of blue-collar, white-collar, and digital talent in supply chains around the world. At the same time, [global skilled talent](https://www.bcg.com/publications/collections/decoding-global-talent) is becoming more mobile: 23% of global skilled workers actively seek to move abroad, according to BCG research.  
  
These trends are reshaping supply chains as countries pursue sharply divergent policies toward immigration. While nations such as the US are becoming more restrictive, Canada, the EU, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and others are opening immigration pathways—especially in science and key technologies—to position themselves as innovation hubs. Among other things, these nations are reforming their visa policies, investing more in recruitment, and forming government-to-government mobility partnerships to secure pipelines of workers. Italy’s Piano Mattei program, for example, is developing partnerships with African nations, supporting training and upskilling in Africa, and granting work visas for program graduates to work in Italian factories. After a few years, they return to their home countries, bringing with them best practices that are valuable for African manufacturers.  
  
To recruit and retain global talent, companies must understand and appeal to these workers’ specific needs. BCG research has found that digital talent, which is in great demand but scarce, tends to gravitate toward cities with strong technology ecosystems and a high quality of life. More companies, therefore, are relocating R&D or even their headquarters to such hubs. But digital talent is very picky, often preferring to work for companies that are digital natives. In response, some companies are rebranding themselves to increase their appeal to digital talent. For example, to better compete for digital talent with EV companies such as Tesla and BYD, legacy automotive OEMs are positioning themselves as technologically forward-looking and stress ways of working that resemble those in the tech world in their recruiting outreach.  
  
In contrast, white-collar workers who are critical to operations, such as engineers and process managers, tend to follow shifts in manufacturing locations. Mobility barriers, such as visa hurdles, can be major constraints on their ability to relocate.  
  
Global competition for blue-collar workers, whom companies now view as critical enablers of industrial strategies, is heating up as well. Aging populations and restrictions on immigration are creating scarcity in Global North industrial centers, and pools of blue-collar workers are also shrinking in many emerging markets in the face of rapid industrialization and inadequate training pipelines. Although recruitment and retention remain strong in auto factories in cities such as Guangzhou, Stuttgart, and Chennai, for example, they are more challenging in São Paulo and Aguascalientes, Mexico. (See the exhibit.) Labor pressures are especially intense in Mexico’s automotive sector in the wake of a $15 billion increase in EV FDI from 2021 through 2024, compared with the previous four years. As a result, manufacturers are starting to shift to less-saturated alternative sites in Central America, such as El Salvador.

Megatrend 4: Adoption of Advanced Robotics 

The steadily falling costs and improving capabilities of advanced robotics are altering the math of global manufacturing, too. Adoption of automation is accelerating in the Global North and in the Global South as companies seek to mitigate rising labor rates and tariffs and as governments try to make domestic production more cost competitive. Semiconductor, EV, and fuel cell manufacturing—industries in which both labor costs and the ability to automate tasks with current technology are high—are among the sectors with the greatest potential for robotics. Sectors such as medtech, by contrast, remain less suitable for advanced automation due to their smaller factories and their need to perform highly specialized tasks. (See the exhibit.)  
Advanced robotics can boost productivity in automotive and logistics by up to 50% and improve quality by up to 25%, according to the International Federation of Robotics and other industry studies. Japan and Western Europe lead in robotics production, R&D, and implementation, but adoption has been growing most rapidly in China, accounting for more than half of installations globally in 2024. That growth is likely to accelerate as a result of a new $138 billion government-backed venture capital fund that targets robotics and other high technologies. Meanwhile, emerging manufacturing powers such as India and Malaysia are approaching a tipping point at which industrial robots will become cheaper to use than human labor.  
  
The automotive sector is the biggest user of robotics. There, the ratio of robots per 1,000 employees is six times the average of other manufacturing industries. From 2020 through 2022, installations rose by 47% in the US and by 26% in China. Consumer electronics and capital-intensive sectors such as metals and machinery are scaling up rapidly, particularly in South Korea and Japan.

## Strategies for Building Cost-Effective and Resilient Supply Chains

Exactly how geopolitics will reshape the business landscape remains unclear. Businesses must therefore prepare their supply chains for a range of scenarios. Economic statecraft, climate-related events, technological advances, and competition for talent are likely to influence the reconfiguration of global supply chains for years to come.

To improve their resilience, many companies are diversifying their manufacturing and sourcing footprints by developing more geographic options. Manufacturers should focus on countries that have low costs and are geopolitically neutral—characteristics that can result in access to more markets.

Geographic **diversification** alone won’t be enough to withstand the consequences of megatrends on supply chains, however. Companies may also need to split capacity across more factories within a country for specific SKUs and to source components from multiple suppliers. Indeed, dual sourcing is becoming the minimum viable standard. Some automotive and medtech companies have already advanced well along this path, lining up more backup suppliers across more component families. We expect this trend to accelerate as tariffs continue to shift.

In particular, we expect to see increased reliance on **supply chain brokers**. These are typically large, sophisticated multinational corporations well established in both the West and the East. Several major suppliers of automotive and electronic components serve this role. They have factories in many countries, giving them great flexibility to control cost—something Chinese firms have struggled to replicate, particularly in North America. This model gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic and has since become quite attractive to OEMs.

All of this diversification could require more redundancies in supply chains, depending on how geopolitics and the future business landscape evolve. For example, in a bipolar world in which a US-led Western bloc competes with a bloc aligned with China and its allies, remaining neutral won’t suffice. Companies may need duplicate supply chains, particularly in strategic sectors such as semiconductors and critical minerals.

On the other hand, if the world becomes more multipolar, businesses will probably have to go beyond duplication and develop more regionalized supply chains. In large, particularly sensitive markets, companies may even need dedicated local-for-local structures. In such a world, nonaligned nations in the Global South are likely to participate in several distinct regional chains. Vietnam, for instance, could contribute to different production networks dedicated to customers in the US, the EU, China, and Southeast Asia.

Each of these pathways could result in higher costs and less efficiency. Companies that best manage the cost of resilience, therefore, will have a competitive edge.

Shared production capacity is becoming a critical enabler. For many companies, making big capital investments in multiple regional greenfield factories is uneconomical, time-consuming, and excessively risky—particularly in an environment in which tariffs, trade policies, and industrial incentives continue to change rapidly and unpredictably.

One approach to shared capacity involves relying more on **contract manufacturers**, much as the electronics and pharmaceutical industries have done for decades. Third-party contractors offer cost-efficient solutions by pooling production in large facilities for multiple clients.

Manufacturing [**joint ventures**](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/mergers-acquisitions-transactions-pmi/joint-ventures-alliances) (JVs) between companies operating in similar sectors offer another option for achieving economies of scale. JVs can build shared factories and devote underutilized capacity to their peers. Automotive and aerospace manufacturers are already adopting this approach to reduce cost. JVs can also serve as strategic tools for managing geopolitical risk, particularly for Chinese firms

This could lead to loss of market share and potential business failure. Secondly, increased manufacturing costs may force the company to raise prices, potentially alienating customers or losing them to competitors offering cheaper alternatives.

Therefore, manufacturing companies must adopt strategies to mitigate the impact of rising costs. By controlling costs, companies can preserve their profit margins, ensuring sustainability in the long run. Moreover, maintaining competitive pricing is essential for retaining existing customers and attracting new ones.

This blog will discuss the top 6 ways how to reduce cost in manufacturing company to improve profitability.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in Q4 2023, [unit labor costs rose by 5.3%,](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/prod2.pdf) driven by a 6.7% rise in hourly compensation and 1.3% productivity increase.

## **How to Calculate Manufacturing Costs in Your Business?**

Calculating manufacturing costs involves summing up all expenses incurred during the production of goods. The process typically includes several key components:

1. **Direct Materials**: These are the raw materials and components directly used in manufacturing. Costs are determined by the quantity consumed and their unit prices.
2. **Direct Labor**: This refers to wages paid to workers directly involved in production. It includes salaries, benefits, and any incentives tied to production output.
3. **Factory Overhead**: Also known as indirect costs, these include expenses not directly attributable to specific units of production. This encompasses utilities, rent, depreciation of machinery, maintenance, and administrative costs associated with the manufacturing facility.

To calculate total manufacturing costs, add up direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead for a specific period. The formula is:

Total Manufacturing Costs = Direct Materials + Direct Labor + Factory Overhead

Accurate calculation is crucial for pricing products competitively, assessing profitability, and making informed decisions about production efficiency. Modern manufacturing often involves sophisticated software systems to track and allocate these costs efficiently, providing managers with real-time insights into operational expenses and profitability margins.

## **Why Reducing Manufacturing Costs is Essential for Business Success?**

To learn the steps for creating a tailored supply chain management plan, read our blog, [‘A 6-step Guide to Create an Effective Supply Chain Management Plan’](https://www.invensis.net/blog/supply-chain-management-plan)

### 5. Negotiate Better Supplier Contracts

Often, companies find themselves locked into unfavorable agreements, facing rising material costs, fluctuating exchange rates, or inconsistent quality from suppliers. These challenges can significantly impact profitability and hinder efforts to streamline operations.

To address these issues and reduce manufacturing costs, negotiating better supplier contracts is essential. By securing favorable terms and conditions, including pricing, payment terms, and quality standards, manufacturing companies can effectively manage costs and mitigate risks in their supply chain. Negotiating better contracts requires thorough research, analysis, and strategic planning to identify areas for improvement and leverage negotiating power.

According to Huthwaite International, companies that did not engage in a negotiation process experienced an  [average decrease in net income of 63.3%](https://www.scotwork.co.uk/thought-leadership/negotiation-statistics/).

‍

**Ways to Manage Manufacturing Costs Through Better Supplier Contracts Negotiation: Top Tips**

* **Volume Discounts:** Negotiate volume discounts or long-term contracts with suppliers to secure lower unit costs and reduce overall expenses.
* **Payment Terms:** Negotiate favorable payment terms such as extended payment periods or early payment discounts to improve cash flow.
* **Quality Guarantees:** Ensure quality guarantees in contracts to reduce the risk of defective materials, minimizing rework costs.
* **Performance Incentives:** Implement performance-based incentives in contracts to encourage suppliers to meet or exceed quality and delivery standards.

### 6. Enhance Inventory Management

Manufacturing companies struggle with issues such as overstocking, stockouts, obsolete inventory, and poor inventory turnover rates. Excessive inventory ties up valuable capital increases storage costs, and poses risks of product deterioration or obsolescence. Inefficient inventory management practices can also result in missed sales opportunities due to stockouts or delays in fulfilling customer orders.

To tackle these challenges head-on and reduce manufacturing costs, enhancing inventory management is essential. This involves Implementing just-in-time (JIT) inventory systems, adopting RFID or barcode technology for real-time tracking, and establishing inventory optimization models are effective strategies to enhance inventory management. Additionally, fostering collaboration with suppliers and implementing vendor-managed inventory (VMI) programs can streamline replenishment processes and reduce lead times.

**Reducing Manufacturing Costs Through Inventory Management - A Case Study**

A real-world case study illustrating enhanced inventory management is Walmart's implementation of RFID technology across its supply chain. In the mid-2000s, Walmart faced challenges with inventory accuracy and stock-outs, impacting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. To tackle these issues, Walmart invested in RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to track products throughout its stores and warehouses in real-time. This initiative enabled Walmart to automate inventory monitoring, reduce manual errors, and optimize stock levels more precisely.  
  
As a result, Walmart improved inventory turnover rates, minimized excess inventory holding costs, and enhanced overall supply chain visibility. The implementation of RFID technology not only reduced costs associated with overstocking and understocking but also improved the availability of products on shelves, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction across Walmart's global operations.(Source: [kcode](https://kcode.com/how-walmart-uses-rfid-technology-to-save-millions/))

By systematically reducing consumption and waste, companies can secure long-term financial resilience and build a competitive advantage in an increasingly eco-conscious market.

## 6. Shared Services Centers

Shared Services Centers (SSCs) are a powerful cost reduction strategy that involves consolidating and centralizing common business functions, such as HR, Finance, and IT, from multiple business units into a single, specialized hub. This approach eliminates redundant roles and systems, standardizes processes, and leverages economies of scale to drive significant operational efficiencies. By centralizing these back-office tasks, businesses can improve service quality, enforce best practices, and free up individual departments to focus on core, value-generating activities.

This model transforms transactional functions into a strategic asset. Instead of each location or division managing its own administrative overhead, the SSC acts as an internal service provider, delivering consistent and high-quality support across the entire organization. This centralization not only reduces direct costs associated with staffing and infrastructure but also enhances control, improves data accuracy, and supports faster decision-making through unified reporting and analytics.

### Actionable Implementation Steps

* **Start with Mature Processes:** Begin by centralizing functions that are highly transactional and well-defined, such as accounts payable or payroll. These areas offer clear opportunities for standardization and quick wins.

* **Invest in Enabling Technology:** Implement a robust technology platform, like an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system or specialized service desk software, to automate workflows, manage requests, and enable efficient service delivery.

### Real-World Success Stories

The impact of shared services is evident across global enterprises. General Electric famously reduced its finance costs by over $500 million by consolidating its financial operations. Similarly, Procter & Gamble's Global Business Services unit achieved savings of more than $900 million over five years by centralizing its administrative functions. Even in capital-intensive industries, the model proves effective; Shell reduced operational costs by 40% through its shared services network while simultaneously improving service quality.

These cases demonstrate that creating Shared Services Centers is more than a simple consolidation exercise. It is a strategic transformation that, when executed correctly, unlocks substantial financial benefits and operational excellence, making it a cornerstone among effective cost reduction strategies.

## 7. Inventory Optimization

Inventory Optimization is a data-driven approach to minimize inventory carrying costs while ensuring high service levels. This strategy involves using advanced analytics, demand forecasting, and sophisticated management techniques to strike the perfect balance between the cost of holding inventory and the risk of stockouts. The goal is to have the right amount of stock, in the right place, at the right time, avoiding both expensive overstock and damaging shortages.

By analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and supply chain lead times, businesses can make more accurate predictions about future demand. This allows for a significant reduction in safety stock and prevents capital from being tied up in slow-moving or obsolete products. Effective inventory optimization is a critical component of modern cost reduction strategies, turning a company's supply chain from a cost center into a competitive advantage.

### Actionable Implementation Steps

# Factory Cost Reduction for Industrial Manufacturers

Unlocking savings while building resilient operations

##### 05.11.2025 | Article



Europe’s industrial backbone is undergoing a structural test. According to the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), production will likely decline by another two percent following an eight percent drop in 2024. The external conditions remain volatile: global supply chains are fragmenting under the weight of geopolitical uncertainty, trade barriers are increasing, and Chinese industrial competitors are rapidly expanding their technological footprint and price competitiveness. For many manufacturers, the result is a dangerous squeeze between persistent cost inflation and weakening demand. Margins are tightening, while high input prices and underutilized assets strain profitability. Factory utilization rates, which averaged 76.9 percent in the second quarter of 2025, illustrate the challenge – specially as several industrial goods producers now operate at less than half of their capacity. Traditionally, cost-cutting efforts have focused on procurement: renegotiating supplier contracts, consolidating demand, or switching materials. Yet this approach has largely exhausted its potential. With Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) representing 60 to 70 percent of total expenses, the next frontier for competitiveness is not to be found in what companies buy – but in how they produce.

**The rising urgency of factory cost-out**

Across the manufacturing landscape, the cost-out agenda has become a strategic imperative. Recent data from the Manufacturing Cost Optimization Survey 2024 show that 87 percent of companies now place factory cost reduction among their top three operational priorities. On average, firms target savings of around twelve percent, while leading performers aim for reductions of up to thirty percent.

Despite this ambition, many programs underdeliver. The reason is not a lack of intent, but a lack of depth. Budget freezes or broad headcount reductions may deliver quick financial relief, yet they rarely build a foundation for lasting competitiveness. In some cases, they even damage productivity, morale, and innovation capacity. Sustainable cost optimization, by contrast, demands structural change: rethinking the very architecture of production networks, decision-making, and performance management.

Cost reduction potentials in manufacturing across different cost categories.



**The 35-percent opportunity**

Benchmarking studies by Porsche Consulting indicate that up to thirty-five percent of total factory costs can be reduced through a structured and holistic approach. This potential can be realized in the way organizations integrate operational excellence, digital transformation, and an optimized organizational design into their day-to-day manufacturing routines. Companies that embed lean methods and continuous improvement disciplines not only eliminate waste but also accelerate material flow and shorten lead times. Simplified organizational structures and clarified roles reduce friction, while smarter ramp-up management ensures that new production lines reach optimal output faster. Digital and AI-driven solutions add another layer of efficiency by enhancing planning precision, improving quality control, and optimizing maintenance schedules through predictive analytics. Energy and resource efficiency are equally central to factory performance. By linking sustainability with productivity, leading manufacturers cut both emissions and cost. Network and footprint adjustments can unlock a further share of savings when executed as part of a broader transformation strategy. This includes decisions on which sites should specialize, scale down, or consolidate. Taken together, the systematic combination of operational excellence, organizational redesign, and optimized production networks can deliver up to a quarter of total cost savings on its own.

**Aligning short‑term wins with strategic vision**

Experience shows that successful cost-out programs share a common structure built around three sequential phases. A rigorous factory cost‑out initiative follows a three-phase structure:

1. **Strategic guardrails:** Starting with a comprehensive cost breakdown: segmenting factory costs into direct personnel, indirect labor, overhead, incidental procurement, and other segments. Companies benchmark themselves against industry averages. This phase includes setting ambition levels by function or site, aligned with long-term corporate goals such as network optimization.
2. **Attack plan:** High-impact levers are prioritized, and pilot actions are launched in select parts of the network to test hypotheses. This phase blends top-down direction with bottom-up input, as program managers collaborate with shop-floor teams to validate feasibility and build ownership.
3. **Safeguarding impact:** Scalable tracking systems monitor action implementation, measure outcomes, and ensure roll-out across sites. The mechanism is structured and includes production network hubs, standardized reporting templates, and experiential exchange sessions. This setup enables “best-practice donations” between plants. KPIs such as utilization rates, OEE, scrap levels, and labor ratios serve as accountability metrics.

Program governance includes clear role definitions, such as local measure owners, PMO-level oversight, and leadership-level performance tracking. Transparency in target vs. actual performance and widely shared dashboards support speed and alignment.

Strategic levers for optimizing manufacturing costs and their impact areas.



**Proof in practice: more than 11 percent savings realized**

In a high-profile example from the machinery industry, a cost-out program delivered more than eleven percent savings on total factory cost, including a 19 percent reduction in indirect personnel expenses. The decisive factor was not a groundbreaking concept, but consistent implementation and derivative scaling. Each manager received concrete targets linked to personal performance reviews, and rapid pilot-to-rollout cycles accelerated learning while avoiding stagnation. The team focused on a handful of high-leverage levers rather than dispersing effort across numerous minor initiatives. Every measure was tracked from idea to financial impact, and by institutionalizing transparency and accountability, the company not only met but exceeded its objectives. It also established a repeatable blueprint for future cost-out programs across its production network. To replicate such results, companies must first understand which parts of factory cost are controllable and how to balance savings with strategic priorities.

**Understanding cost drivers and balancing strategic trade-offs**

A thorough understanding of which parts of factory cost are controllable is essential for any effective cost-out program. Approximately 79 percent of factory costs can be influenced, with the largest categories being direct personnel, which account for 40 to 50 percent of costs and primarily include production wages; indirect personnel, representing 20 to 30 percent and covering support staff and supervision; and overhead, which also accounts for 20 to 30 percent and includes energy, facilities, maintenance, IT, and leasing. Smaller but still significant areas include incidental procurement, such as materials, consumables, and outsourced services, as well as miscellaneous costs, which account for five to 15 percent. Within overhead, energy and maintenance often provide actionable savings but historically receive less attention than labor. Metrics such as OEE, inventory days, typically 30 to 120 depending on the industrial segment, automation levels, and utilization highlight additional opportunities for operational improvement.

Yet identifying cost drivers is only half the challenge. Industrial manufacturers must also balance short-term savings with long-term strategic alignment. Workforce reductions should retain critical skills for automation, digitization, and new product introduction, while product simplification must preserve flexibility to respond to customer variation. Footprint adjustments should be planned with resilience in mind, ensuring plants can handle multi-client requirements and potential future volume recovery. Programs that embed such strategic guardrails allow companies to achieve meaningful cost reductions without compromising future competitiveness. Freed-up capital can then be reinvested in Industry 4.0 initiatives, digital supply chain ecosystems, or energy-efficient production redesigns, turning efficiency gains into a foundation for sustainable growth.

**Unconventional levers for next-level performance**

Three unconventional approaches distinguish top-tier cost-out initiatives by going beyond conventional lean deployments and combining technology, behavioral redesign, and advanced analytics.

1. **Dynamic labor models (e.g. “dark factories”):** explore shifts toward nighttime or weekend production using a skeleton crew, cutting indirect labor and increasing overall utilization. Such models require reimagining scheduling, shift structure, and ergonomics.
2. **AI-driven predictive maintenance paired with shared sensor platforms across plants:** Using cross-site data-sharing to detect and pre-empt breakdowns delivers cost savings through reduced downtime and maintenance cost avoidance.
3. **Value-based design simplification:** Rather than eliminating variants through cost-center mandates, align product variation decisions with value creation. This includes evaluating SKU profit contribution, re-order frequency, and overall defect costs to guide simplification decisions.

**Turning cost-out into lasting transformation**

Even the most sophisticated cost-out programs face risks. If savings targets dominate the narrative without sufficient engagement, morale can suffer and resistance can grow. If execution speed outpaces quality assurance, defect rates and rework can erode the very gains achieved. And if indirect roles are reduced too aggressively, the company may inadvertently weaken its innovation pipeline.

Effective governance mitigates these risks through structured change management, clear communication of purpose, and retention of strategic skill sets. Pilot phases and continuous quality monitoring create an evidence base for scaling, ensuring that ambition is matched by capability.

Industrial manufacturers stand before a generational opportunity. By activating targeted operational, organizational, and digital levers, they can unlock between 20 and 35 percent of total factory cost savings. The decisive difference lies not in the framework itself, but in the discipline of its execution.

Programs that align cost-out initiatives with strategic goals, embed transparent performance tracking, and scale through fast learning loops create not only leaner operations – but also more resilient and future-ready organizations.

#### Key Takeaways

Up to 35 percent factory cost savings are achievable by coordinating high leverage levers such as Operational Excellence, Organizational Design, and Network optimization.

Effective programs integrate short term liquidity gains with long term digital and innovation goals, ensuring cost-out serves as a strategic enabler – not a deterrent.

Execution quality is the decisive factor: clear leadership accountability, rapid pilots, and scaled tracking separate impactful transformation from superficial initiatives.

Relevant Content: ### How to improve supplier collaboration

The best way to clear all three barriers is by using a software tool designed for supplier teamwork. Collaboration software like CoLab can host the design for manufacturing process on a single platform, enrolling the host to handle security specifically fit for the application.

The single-platform approach lets both design and manufacturing access the latest model version in real time, attaching the feedback to the 3D model for the clearest communication possible. This solution lets team members from either team check the review status at any time, and it handles admin tasks so stakeholders can check in whenever they want. This strengthens the working relationship with the supplier.

Conclusion [...] This is rhetorical, of course. But however good communicating with the supply base is, there are always areas for improvement. An effective way many manufacturers are using is to adopt a more Agile-like approach: increasing the number of check-ins with part providers and involving them earlier in the design process.

But in practice, there are a few realities that challenge this way of working, such as:

1.   Protecting security
2.   Strained supplier relationships
3.   Poor communication processes

The good news is that there are practical solutions engineering teams can take to overcome these barriers.

### Barrier 1: Security risks [...] ### Barrier 2: Strained supplier relationships

In all elements of life, healthy relationships require time and effort. Unfortunately, the challenge with manufacturing is that supplier-manufacturer relationships usually start with discussions over time and money – two stressful and high-friction areas.

In addition, even if the agreement is ongoing with a trusted partner, working with an external partner naturally bends toward a transaction, not a real collaboration. Continuing this way leads to a project management approach that checks items off of action item lists instead of creating the best product within the time and budget they have.

Hands up: who's got supplier communication figured out and optimized?

This is rhetorical, of course. But however good communicating with the supply base is, there are always areas for improvement. An effective way many manufacturers are using is to adopt a more Agile-like approach: increasing the number of check-ins with part providers and involving them earlier in the design process.

But in practice, there are a few realities that challenge this way of working, such as:

1.   Protecting security
2.   Strained supplier relationships
3.   Poor communication processes

The good news is that there are practical solutions engineering teams can take to overcome these barriers.

### Barrier 1: Security risks

One of the biggest hurdles manufacturers face is the need to share sensitive data outside the walls. This need leads to a natural trade-off between data security and speeding up sending data back and forth.

A tie between security and speed usually results in leaders choosing to protect data security. And for a good reason: often, this data contains sensitive information, trade secrets, or approaches that companies want to shield from competition before the product launch – if ever.

However, cumbersome security protocols result in less collaboration or engineers navigating around the approved security protocols in the name of ""driving for results."" But it doesn't have to be like this!

### Barrier 2: Strained supplier relationships

In all elements of life, healthy relationships require time and effort. Unfortunately, the challenge with manufacturing is that supplier-manufacturer relationships usually start with discussions over time and money – two stressful and high-friction areas.

In addition, even if the agreement is ongoing with a trusted partner, working with an external partner naturally bends toward a transaction, not a real collaboration. Continuing this way leads to a project management approach that checks items off of action item lists instead of creating the best product within the time and budget they have.

The good news is that winning teams realize the importance of repairing commercial awkwardness during the supply agreement and move quickly toward a technical partnership. This shared goal creates the chance to improve how the teams work together to remove the wall between companies and allow them to work as one team.

Every interaction between the combined design team contributes to the output – good or bad. As a result, when communicating with suppliers is difficult, building strong supplier relationships is too. In the end, the final product suffers.

### Barrier 3: Inefficient communication

One of the most common drivers of strained supplier relationships is inefficient communication. Using existing organization-based tools (Excel lists, Word docs, PowerPoint decks, or worse…email!) invite nearly countless chances for miscommunication.

Tell me if any of these methods sound familiar:

*   Manufacturer designers ""PowerPoint engineer"" a JPEG of a CAD file on a slide with text boxes annotating changes
*   A slide contains numbers that represent a series of change notes on a 2D model image. These notes correspond to a spreadsheet or document with explanations
*   The design and supplier teams volley an email chain back and forth dozens of times. The emails have embedded images and thesis-length explanations beside them (don't forget to overlay the text!)

All of these approaches have drawbacks that reduce efficiency and create a chance for human error. Although Office tools are familiar and available, they are everywhere! They are so common that engineers have created a ton of non-standard processes for supplier collaboration.

The supplier team may overlook secondary but critical feedback while focusing on a major change. Or, the different groups could be working with outdated versions of a CAD file, only to discover the mismatch weeks or months later.

The worst outcome of inefficient communication is having decision-makers misaligned due to a lack of clarity. A note in a slide or email may be taken differently or applied to a different feature in one team member's mind than another. This changes the reviewer's perspective and may lead to a decision they didn't want to make.

Framing an advanced approach to remove the barriers

Fortunately, there is a better path to removing the invisible wall between designer and manufacturer through improved collaboration. All three of the barriers described above stem from applying tools designed for in-house manufacturing teams to a contract manufacturing environment:

*   Security concerns are significantly easier to solve between internal departments under the same IT system and oversight.
*   With in-house manufacturing, the agreement between design and manufacturing already exists when employees join the company. Technical leaders can smooth out any issues between the teams simply by the nature of their positions.
*   Communication is easier due to there being no wall – virtual or otherwise – between the internal groups. Team members can freely walk over to each other's offices (or ping each other via Teams or Zoom for follow-up questions).

Still, the communication prong, maybe the most important when converging a complex design, invites errors if the team collaborates using outdated approaches. As a result, striving for all in-house manufacturing will not solve all the issues. It would cost you the benefits of supplier resiliency and rapid scaling when production ramps up.

There is a better way to collaborate with suppliers to address all three barriers effectively. The best process should alleviate security concerns, enable stronger relationships, and simplify back-and-forth communication so that suppliers can participate during the design process to bake manufacturing process considerations into the product design.

### How to improve supplier collaboration

The best way to clear all three barriers is by using a software tool designed for supplier teamwork. Collaboration software like CoLab can host the design for manufacturing process on a single platform, enrolling the host to handle security specifically fit for the application.

The single-platform approach lets both design and manufacturing access the latest model version in real time, attaching the feedback to the 3D model for the clearest communication possible. This solution lets team members from either team check the review status at any time, and it handles admin tasks so stakeholders can check in whenever they want. This strengthens the working relationship with the supplier.

Conclusion
----------

Using a single tool with managed security, 3D annotations, and the flexibility to accept [all major file types](https://help.colabsoftware.com/article/supported-file-formats) removes the common barriers to supplier collaboration. When working with a manufacturing partner, clearing these barriers lets the technical teams partner with fewer constraints to get down to the important work: making a great, manufacturable product.

The pandemic may have [pushed supply chains to the top of the corporate agenda](/featured-insights/themes/a-spotlight-on-supply-chains), but the topic was already on the rise. Ambitious environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets require original-equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers to track, manage, and communicate data on their carbon emissions and labor practices across all tiers of their supplier networks. And, with suppliers responsible for 80 percent of total product value in industries such as automotive, supplier cost, quality, innovation, and delivery performance remain critical to business success.

Companies know that [closer collaboration with their suppliers is a powerful way to drive improvement](/capabilities/operations/our-insights/taking-supplier-collaboration-to-the-next-level) across all these dimensions. But the vision of a truly integrated supply chain has proved difficult to realize. OEMs and suppliers seeking to increase data sharing and collaboration across their supply networks have faced three principal hurdles.

*Technology.* The current technologies used to exchange data between supply-chain participants tend to be relatively unsophisticated. The electronic data interchange (EDI) standard widely used in the automotive sector, for example, allows only limited information on forecasts, orders, and delivery schedules to be shared between two companies.

*Operating model.* Participants have not yet developed standards for the exchange of more complex data, from the carbon footprint of parts to the real-time location of products as they move through logistics networks.

*Trust.* Trust is an important issue for participants from two perspectives. First, some data is considered too sensitive to share with external partners. Second, participants often lack a common understanding of the value or accuracy of one another’s data. That makes it difficult for organizations to agree on the terms and incentives for data sharing projects. And it can make them reluctant to integrate external data into their own management and planning systems.

## The value of integration

In one [McKinsey survey](/capabilities/operations/our-insights/taking-supplier-collaboration-to-the-next-level) of more than 100 large organizations in multiple sectors, companies that regularly collaborated with suppliers demonstrated higher growth, lower operating costs, and greater profitability than their industry peers. To offer a more granular view of the potential impact of highly integrated supply chains, we modeled the supply chains of one major industry: the automotive sector. The car industry provides an informative test case because its supply chain is complex, and industry players have already worked hard to drive efficiency and squeeze out waste to increase their usually-low margins.

Our analysis took a deliberately narrow view of the supply chain, looking at the potential efficiency gains generated through the integration of day-to-day activities: supply-chain planning and execution, logistics planning and execution, and quality management. We modeled the impact of integration across the end-to-end value chain from “tier-n” suppliers through vehicle OEMs to dealers, including the role of the logistics-service providers that manage and execute the flow of materials, components, and finished vehicles (Exhibit 1).

### Would you like to learn more about our [Operations Practice](/capabilities/operations/how-we-help-clients)?

[Visit our Manufacturing & Supply Chain page](/capabilities/operations/how-we-help-clients/manufacturing-supply-chain)

For the global automotive industry, we found that integrating those activities could save OEMs and their suppliers between €40 and €65 billion per year. At the 5 to 7 percent margin typical in the industry, that represents a 50 percent profitability boost.

The largest benefit we identified came from greater production efficiency at supplier sites. Integrated planning helps suppliers run stable operations, with fewer schedule changes, changeovers between products, and extra shifts. The process also works the other way. If upstream suppliers cannot meet a customer request, early warnings may allow downstream players to adjust their schedules, minimizing disruption and maintaining output. In our model, planning improvements accounted for €25 to €50 billion in benefits.

Another large benefit came from reducing inventories across the supply chain. High inventory levels are often the result of unreliable or uncertain forecasts, or lack of communication about production-schedule changes that will affect material call-offs in a just-in-time operating environment. Addressing these issues through collaborative, end-to-end planning could save the industry a further €6 to €8 billion on inventory costs, freeing up capital.

The third largest impact came from improvements in transportation efficiency. Increasing the overall utilization of transport assets and reducing the number of emergency deliveries is expected to save the industry €2 to €4 billion. Better transport utilization also improves the industry’s carbon footprint, allowing it to keep components flowing with fewer truck journeys and less airfreight.

Finally, integration would help companies manage quality in their production operations. Linking data on production process parameters, test results, and transport and storage conditions to parts as they move through the supply chain will aid the identification of quality issues, accelerate root-cause problem solving, and allow suspect parts to isolated when problems occur. In the automotive sector, that could be worth around €1-2 billion every year.

## Building a truly integrated supply chain

How would organizations capture all this value? Our modeling is based on the introduction of systems that allow multiple data streams from supply-chain participants and external sources to be integrated in a single platform. That platform would be used to exchange demand forecasts, jointly optimize production and logistics schedules, and track operations and asset information in real time across the end-to-end value chain (Exhibit 2).

Beyond the technical challenges of establishing such a system, supply-chain participants also need to find a fair way to run it. The opportunities identified in our analysis cannot be captured by any single party operating alone; they require collaborative action by multiple players. Furthermore, the benefits of supply-chain integration initiatives don’t necessarily accrue to the organizations that put in the most work. Better medium-term forecasts and commitments for parts subject to highly variable demand help suppliers optimize their production capacity—but the cost of building and updating those forecasts falls to the OEM. To make such arrangements work, participants will want to align on a mutual and fair mechanism for the sharing of efficiency gains, while incentivizing the information exchange for both parties.

A data-governance and operating model to facilitate successful data-based collaboration includes awareness on the relative value of data internally and for partners, the ability to manage data along its lifecycle (consistent ontology, data quality assurance), the ability to extract value through application and analytics (analytics capabilities, use-case identification), and the ability to share data securely and stay in control (data-sharing standards).

### Can your supply chain deliver what your consumer wants?

[Read the article](/capabilities/operations/our-insights/can-your-supply-chain-deliver-what-your-consumer-wants)

### The technology is ready

Many companies are already using technology and analytics internally as part of their [Industry 4.0 vision](/featured-insights/world-economic-forum/knowledge-collaborations/the-future-of-production). The requirements of Fourth Industrial Revolution implementations have, to a large extent, been mapped to solutions for most of the technology challenges. The [technology stack for the Internet of Things (IoT) platforms](/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/a-manufacturers-guide-to-generating-value-at-scale-with-industrial-iot) used to coordinate manufacturing operations is becoming well defined and widely used.

And a number of technology players provide systems that enable near-real-time sharing of data between entities and supply-chain partners. These cloud-based platforms can link to a wide range of IoT and enterprise resource-planning (ERP) systems, offering off-the-shelf solutions to data management, security, access rights, and control challenges. They also provide an environment in which participants can apply machine learning and advanced analytics tools to extract insights from shared supply-chain data.

Manufacturing players and software companies have developed the ability to create digital twins of components, complete machines, entire factories, and even supply-chain relationships—modeling all relevant parameters in near real-time. These digital twins contain all relevant data points and relations to model the production system and optimize its performance using analytics and artificial intelligence.

Recognizing the potential of these new technologies, several large manufacturers have started to implement cloud-based platforms to support internal Industry 4.0 developments and provide improved connectivity with suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders. In the automotive sector, several leading tier-1 suppliers have worked with OEMs to create joint platforms with the goal of supply-chain optimization. Likewise, players in the aerospace sector have developed systems used to share maintenance and asset-performance data throughout the value chain, through to asset owners and service providers.

### Overcoming the barriers to collaboration

The development of suitable technologies has been an important step, but platforms alone are insufficient to enable deep integration between supply-chain participants. Industrial IoT platforms work nicely to drive efficiency within companies, but collaboration along the supply chain requires further enablers. For example, players will need to agree as to how those platforms will be used, align on standards for data exchange, agree on rights over data access and ownership, and establish common conventions for the naming of objects, products, and events in the supply chain. Moreover, since in many industries suppliers serve several customers, these standards and conventions should be as open as possible, so companies can easily integrate their own systems with those of multiple partners. Defining open standards for data exchange, as well as a joint ontology for data, is only just beginning and will mean close collaboration with technology and cloud providers.

To put the necessary infrastructure and standards in place, we foresee the need for a collaboration “orchestrator” within the supply chain. The orchestrator would work with supply-chain participants to foster agreement on appropriate standards and protocols, and build the digital platform for data exchange. In some supply chains, such as in the automotive industry, the OEM might perform this orchestrator role, using its scale and strong relationships with tier-1 suppliers to do the heavy lifting required to get digitally enabled supply-chain collaboration off the ground. In other sectors, the orchestrator could be a third party, funded or supported by multiple OEMs and major suppliers.

A supply-chain technology orchestrator can help in overcoming technology and resource challenges— but they may not be able to resolve the trust issue. Where the orchestrator is also a major customer in the supply chain, other participants may be concerned about sharing sensitive data. And where the value created by integration projects is to be shared among participants, suppliers need to be confident that calculated improvements are derived from accurate data and a fair baseline.

In cases such as these, supply participants may wish to appoint a “trustee”—an impartial third party that can review potentially sensitive data from multiple participants and help them establish equitable incentive arrangements. Modern technologies such as blockchain or homomorphic encryption may provide the necessary toolkit to run a cross-industry data-sharing platform while ensuring trust from all parties involved.

### Steps towards impact

Solving the inherent challenges of supplier collaboration is always a bilateral discussion, requiring a joint understanding of the potential and commitment to closer collaboration. Such efforts require a first mover to initiate the discussions, however. This could be a leading OEM, a major player elsewhere in the market (perhaps one facing significant cost pressure), or a group of like-minded stakeholders.

We see a clear separation between first assessing the impact at stake and the required capabilities, and then building the technology infrastructure and governance to realize the potential. To prepare, a company can take several initial actions that are largely under its own control.

* *Identify leading suppliers within its own supply chain* and the products or components with optimization potential (ideally components of high value, high demand fluctuation, and high criticality for the manufacturing process).
* *Engage with suppliers to identify today’s largest pain points,* and potential data-driven solutions.
* *Pinpoint critical enablers for realizing the potential,* such as the exact data that needs to be shared, the data’s cyclicality, the required level of data protection, and the types of analytics that are needed.
* *Synthesize and generalize use cases so that they form a scalable platform,* with common data formats, standards, ontology, and interfaces that enable it to be extended readily to other use cases and suppliers.
* *Define the platform’s operating model and governance structure,* creating data-sharing mechanism and clarifying critical roles, such as those of the platform orchestrator and operator and the data-sharing trustee (if needed to protect highly sensitive data).

---

If participants can work together to overcome barriers—including common operating standards, trust, and appropriate gain sharing—they could significantly reduce costs and improve resilience. Greater integration will also serve as basis for an end-to-end focus on sustainability. It is one key enabler for the fast, flexible, sustainable and efficient supply chain of the future.

# Why Sustainability is Becoming Critical for Manufacturers in 2024

In an era where environmental concerns are taking center stage, sustainability has emerged as a critical driver of success for manufacturers, big and small. Governments, consumers, and stakeholders increasingly prioritize sustainable practices, urging manufacturers to reevaluate their operations.

While large corporations have been at the forefront of manufacturing sustainability trends, in 2024, more small and mid-sized manufacturers are expected to incorporate green initiatives, recognizing that sustainability is essential for their bottom line. Embracing manufacturing sustainability is becoming a strategic necessity, and in this blog, we’ll explore the key reasons why.

## 1. Gain Additional Customers

In 2024, many consumers and businesses will make purchasing decisions based on a company’s commitment to sustainability. A study by Nielsen found that 66% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. Smaller manufacturers can tap into this expanding market by adopting sustainable practices, attracting eco-conscious customers, and gaining a competitive edge.

Manufacturers can showcase their [commitment to manufacturing sustainability](/blog/how-can-manufacturers-build-resilience-and-become-sustainable/) by tracking and reporting environmental metrics, such as reduced carbon emissions, efficient resource utilization, and eco-friendly materials usage. This data transparency appeals to potential customers and can be a compelling selling point.

## 2. Reduce Waste

Manufacturers can take several proactive steps to reduce waste and promote greater sustainable manufacturing in their operations. First and foremost, they can implement lean manufacturing principles that focus on minimizing waste at every production stage. This involves optimizing processes to reduce overproduction, wait times, unnecessary transportation, and [excess inventory](/blog/6-ways-reduce-inventory-levels/), which not only conserves resources but also saves money. Additionally, manufacturers can design products with a longer lifespan and easier recyclability, reducing the need for constant replacements and minimizing the amount of waste generated. Using eco-friendly materials and efficient production techniques can also contribute to waste reduction and sustainability in manufacturing. Waste prevention is a business strategy from which any company can benefit, regardless of size or type. In addition to cost savings, it can help you improve worker safety, reduce liability, and enhance your image in the community. Furthermore, if the waste you are eliminating or reducing is regulated under state or federal law – and your reductions are significant enough – you might be able to avoid costly permits and government approvals.

Another crucial aspect of waste reduction is effective waste management and recycling programs. Manufacturers can set up systems to efficiently sort, recycle, and repurpose materials, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Collaborating with suppliers and customers to create a closed-loop supply chain can further promote sustainability by facilitating the recovery and reuse of materials. Manufacturers can also invest in energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources to reduce energy consumption and associated waste. Overall, a comprehensive approach to waste reduction not only benefits the environment but also enhances a manufacturer’s reputation, saves costs, and aligns with the growing demand for sustainable products and practices in the market.

## 3. Lower Energy Costs

Manufacturers can reap numerous advantages by reducing their energy costs to enhance sustainability. First and foremost, a more energy-efficient operation translates to substantial cost savings. By implementing energy-saving measures, such as upgrading equipment, [optimizing processes](/ensure-manufacturing-success-with-an-erp-software/), and adopting renewable energy sources, manufacturers can lower their utility bills significantly. Many governments and regulatory bodies offer incentives and subsidies to encourage sustainable practices, such as tax credits and grants. These cost reductions can directly enhance a company’s bottom line, allowing it to invest in other critical business areas, such as research and development, expansion, or employee development.

**Also Read:** [**How Can Manufacturers Build Resilience and Become Sustainable?**](/blog/how-can-manufacturers-build-resilience-and-become-sustainable/)

## 4. Increase Efficiency

Increasing efficiencies in manufacturing processes is essential for manufacturers looking to enhance sustainability. By [optimizing production methods](/blog/how-to-achieve-line-balancing-and-its-benefits/), manufacturers can reduce energy consumption, waste generation, and resource usage. This results in lower operational costs and a decreased carbon footprint. Improved efficiency can also lead to the development of more environmentally friendly products and materials, such as using recycled materials or innovative technologies. [Streamlined logistics](/blog/critical-logistics-kpis-manufacturers-and-distributors-should-track/) and supply chain management can minimize transportation-related emissions. [Efficiency gains](/blog/maximize-operational-efficiency-with-smart-manufacturing/) often go hand in hand with reduced downtime, extended equipment lifespan, and improved employee satisfaction.

## 5. Enhance Employee Satisfaction

When a company prioritizes sustainability practices, such as reducing waste, conserving resources, and minimizing its environmental footprint, it fosters a more positive work environment. Sustainable initiatives often promote a sense of purpose among employees, contributing to something greater than profit margins. Moreover, sustainable companies tend to be more transparent, ethical, and socially responsible, which aligns with the values of a modern workforce. This alignment of values and purpose creates a sense of pride, engagement, and fulfillment among employees, ultimately driving higher job satisfaction, retention, and productivity.

## Final Thoughts

Small to medium-sized manufacturers are the backbone of the global economy. In the United States alone, they make up 98.5% of all manufacturing firms and employ over 47% of the manufacturing workforce. Given their sheer number and collective impact, these manufacturers can play a pivotal role in shaping a more sustainable future.

[Sustainability](/blog/how-can-manufacturers-build-resilience-and-become-sustainable/) is becoming essential for smaller manufacturers to help them increase their competitive advantage and satisfy customers, stakeholders, and employees. By aligning with green initiatives, smaller manufacturers can secure their place in an environmentally conscious future while also enjoying the benefits of cost savings and market growth.

Relevant Content: Policy is the biggest driver. In the U.S., the General Services Administration (GSA) now requires low-embodied-carbon concrete, steel, asphalt, and glass for federal projects (GSA, 2024). In Europe, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) enters its definitive phase in 2026, imposing carbon costs on imported cement, steel, and aluminum (European Commission, 2023). For purchasers, these rules transform carbon performance from a “nice-to-have” into a baseline for bid eligibility.​ [...] At the same time, transparency tools are reshaping procurement. BuildingTransparency’s EC3 platform now hosts more than 157,000 Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), used by over 52,000 professionals across 76 countries (BuildingTransparency, 2024). EPDs are quickly becoming standard submittals, which means that buyers must increasingly prioritize materials backed by verified carbon data alongside cost and performance.​

Health is also driving material choices. The EPA reports indoor air can be 2–5 times more polluted than outdoor air (EPA, 2024), with people spending up to 90% of their time indoors. Materials that avoid VOCs, formaldehyde, and toxic adhesives are no longer niche and rather are essential to meet client wellness standards.​ [...] The market signals confirm this shift. The global green building materials market is estimated to be$374.67 billion and is projected to hit $894.74 billion by 2032 (Precedence Research, 2024). Growth is being fueled by policy mandates, corporate climate goals, and investor scrutiny, all of which directly affect the purchasing standards fabricators must meet.​

Trends in the Sustainable Materials Market for 2025 and Beyond

As we move through 2025, sustainability is cementing itself as a standard for the building materials industry, transforming into a procurement requirement. Buildings account for ~34% of global CO₂ emissions and ~32% of total energy use (IEA, 2024), and regulators are pushing hard to reduce that footprint. The message is clear: the products you stock today will decide whether you stay competitive tomorrow.​

The market signals confirm this shift. The global green building materials market is estimated to be$374.67 billion and is projected to hit $894.74 billion by 2032 (Precedence Research, 2024). Growth is being fueled by policy mandates, corporate climate goals, and investor scrutiny, all of which directly affect the purchasing standards fabricators must meet.​

Sustainable Materials in Manufacturing: Choices, Benefits, and Trends
=====================================================================

BIM&CO News-11/12/2023 27/03/2025

[](javascript:history.back())

_Investing in environmentally friendly materials mitigates the construction sector’s impact and addresses the growing infrastructure needs._

_This article explores concrete solutions and showcases manufacturers focused on using sustainable materials to reduce the impact of the construction sector._

******The Construction Sector: A High-Impact Industry on the Environment******
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rapid expansion of construction and infrastructure poses a significant environmental challenge. It’s imperative to rethink our approach to construction materials. According to a [study by Architecture 2030](https://www.architecture2030.org/why-the-built-environment/#:~:text=Buildings%20generate%20nearly%2040%25%20of,for%20an%20additional%2011%25%20annually), the built environment accounts for **approximately 42% of the world’s annual CO2 emissions**.

**Building operations** constitute about **27% of annual total emissions**. Additionally, the embodied carbon from materials like cement, iron, steel, and aluminum adds 15% each year.

The built environment is the primary use of high-impact materials. Taking measures to reduce these impacts is crucial because once a project is completed, embodied carbon emissions are fixed and irreducible. It’s essential to act now to disrupt this trend.

What are the current trends to mitigate this significant environmental impact ?

******2023 Trends in Sustainable Materials******
------------------------------------------------

In sustainable materials, trends are emerging for eco-friendly construction, addressing environmental concerns and respecting resources.

### ******Recycled and Recyclable Materials******

Recycled materials, including recycled wood, metal, glass, and plastic, are gaining popularity. Manufacturers are developing products using recycled materials or are recyclable at the end of their useful life.

For instance, a school renovation center in Vancouver used recycled wood for its extension. This demonstrates the efficiency of recycled materials in construction, reducing the demand for new resources and construction waste.

### ****Bio-sourced Materials****

**Biobased materials** from renewable resources such as bamboo, cork, hemp, or even mushrooms are gaining popularity. Valued for their low carbon footprint and carbon storage capacity.

**Bio’bric**, an innovative company, utilizes biobased materials like clay bricks to reduce the carbon footprint in construction.

**Clay bricks**, derived from renewable resources, promote healthier and more sustainable indoor environments.

[](https://www.bimandco.com/fr/fabricants/528-biobric/details?utm_campaign=blog-materiaux-durables-122023-fr&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=FR&utm_source=bimandco)[BIM Objects from the Manufacturer Bio’bric®](https://www.bimandco.com/en/manufacturers/528-biobric/details?utm_source=bimandco&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog-materiauxdurables-122023&utm_content=EN)

### ****Eco-friendly Insulation****

**Ecological insulation materials** like sheep’s wool and hemp are gaining popularity for their thermal efficiency and low environmental impact.

A concrete example is the renovation of an **old textile factory in Manchester**, where sheep’s wool was used for insulation, providing both comfort and durability.

### ****Smart Materials****

**Smart materials**, such as **liquid crystal windows**, enhance building energy efficiency. For instance, liquid crystal windows adjust opacity based on sunlight, reducing energy consumption.

Motivated by the need to combat energy waste, these materials address growing environmental concerns while harnessing innovation potential to create more sustainable buildings.

### ****Low Carbon Emission Materials****

**Low-carbon emission materials**aim to reduce the carbon footprint associated with their production. This includes materials like low-cement concrete, low-carbon steels, and alternatives to petroleum-based plastics.

**Bubendorff,**by developing carbon-neutral roller shutters and solar protection, demonstrates how it’s possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the construction sector.

Certified products, with their increased longevity, significantly contribute to reducing the overall carbon footprint of buildings. Owners also benefit from long-term savings due to the durability of these shutters.

[![Image 12: BUBENDORFF Manufacturer's BIM Objects](https://www.bimandco.com/bim/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unnamed-2-1024x419.png)](https://www.bimandco.com/en/manufacturers/1114-bubendorff/details?utm_source=bimandco&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog-materiauxdurables-122023&utm_content=EN)

[BUBENDORFF Manufacturer’s BIM Objects](https://www.bimandco.com/en/manufacturers/1114-bubendorff/details?utm_source=bimandco&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog-materiauxdurables-122023&utm_content=EN)

### Materials with low emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

The growing adoption of materials with low **VOC**emissions in the interior finishes of buildings is motivated by the increasing concern for indoor air quality. A concrete example of their use is the renovation of the headquarters of the company “[**XYZ Corp**](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/XYZCOZ:JP?embedded-checkout=true),” aiming to create a healthy work environment.

This trend stems from the awareness of the harmful effects of indoor pollutants on health, leading to the evolution of regulations and construction standards favoring environmentally and public health-friendly materials.

### ****Materials that reduce water waste****

**Effective water resource management** is a major concern in the construction sector. **Presto**stands out by offering sustainable faucets that significantly reduce water waste.

These faucets and control systems are designed to operate optimally while minimizing water consumption. They thus contribute to preserving water resources, which is essential in a context of resource scarcity.

[![Image 13: BIM objects from the manufacturer Presto Ibérica](https://www.bimandco.com/bim/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Capture-d%C3%A9cran-2023-12-06-155737.png)](https://www.bimandco.com/en/manufacturers/530-presto-iberica/details?utm_source=bimandco&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog-materiauxdurables-122023&utm_content=EN)

[BIM objects from the manufacturer Presto Ibérica](https://www.bimandco.com/en/manufacturers/530-presto-iberica/details?utm_source=bimandco&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog-materiauxdurables-122023&utm_content=EN)

### ****Self-healing and Self-cleaning Materials****

Furthermore, research is advancing in the field of materials that can self-repair and self-clean, thereby reducing the need for frequent renovations and maintenance.

A concrete example of the application of these materials is the project of the **self-healing concrete bridge located in the Netherlands**. In this project, researchers have incorporated capsules filled with bacteria into the concrete. When cracks form, water penetrates and activates the bacteria that produce calcium carbonate, thus filling the cracks and restoring the material’s integrity.

This innovative approach not only increases the lifespan of the bridge but also reduces the need for costly repairs and minimizes the environmental impact associated with cement production.

### ****Carbon Capture Materials****

Additionally, some materials are designed to **absorb carbon dioxide (CO2)** from the atmosphere during their lifecycle, thereby contributing to the fight against climate change.

A notable example is the development of innovative construction materials such as **green cement-based concretes**, which incorporate materials like fly ash and slag, thus capturing CO2 during their manufacturing process.

These materials significantly reduce the carbon footprint of infrastructure, thereby contributing to the battle against climate change.

### ****Ecological Façade Coatings****

Finally, **green facade coatings**, such as green walls and facades with integrated solar panels, are increasingly being used to improve the energy efficiency of buildings while adding an ecological aesthetic.

Green walls enhance the thermal efficiency of the building, providing natural insulation and contributing to urban biodiversity.

The adoption of these ecological facade coatings is driven by a growing awareness of the need to promote more sustainable urban environments and reduce energy consumption in buildings.

![Image 14: Revêtements de façade écologiques](https://www.bimandco.com/bim/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unnamed-1-1024x703.png)
******The Benefits of Sustainable Materials******
-------------------------------------------------

in construction, the use of sustainable materials offers numerous advantages for users, the environment, and manufacturers.

### ****Benefits for Users****

Sustainable materials are often chosen for their ability to **enhance occupants’ comfort**. For example, **improved thermal insulation** helps maintain a more stable indoor temperature, creating a more pleasant environment. Furthermore, the use of healthy materials contributes to improving indoor air quality, thus promoting the health of inhabitants.

Another advantage of sustainable materials lies in their **long-term savings**. These materials are typically designed to be more durable, reducing maintenance costs over time. Additionally, their increased energy efficiency can result in substantial savings on energy bills, benefiting both occupants and the environment.

In terms of **thermal and acoustic comfort**, certain sustainable materials, such as high-quality insulation, can improve thermal regulation inside buildings, ensuring more comfortable temperatures. Moreover, these materials can also reduce noise disturbances from the outside, creating a quieter and more comfortable environment for inhabitants.

# How Partnerships Can Build More Resilient and Sustainable Supply Chains

June 21, 2022  6 minute read

By [Tim Moore and Anna Casey](https://www.resonanceglobal.com/blog/author/tim-moore-and-anna-casey)

Now more than ever, we’re seeing the critical importance of resilient, ethical, and sustainable supply chains.

The actions companies take within their supply chains will have profound implications for the climate, the food crisis, gender empowerment, global economic opportunity, and the overall success of the global [Sustainable Development Agenda](/blog/5-priority-un-sustainable-development-goals-for-company-action-in-2021).

Supply chain sustainability and resilience are also matters of core business: Recent global supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 have demonstrated the vulnerability of our systems and the devastating ripple effects supply shocks can wreak on a company, communities, and the environment.

In today’s world, creating truly sustainable and reliable supply chains requires the actions and efforts of more than just one company. Recognizing the need for system-wide change, [companies are turning to cross-sector partnerships](/partnership-development) to generate more effective solutions.  

Here, we’ve compiled seven examples of promising cross-sector partnerships poised to build more resilient and sustainable supply chains.  

## 7 Ways Cross-Sector Partnerships Build More Resilient and Sustainable Supply Chains

Below, we share seven [cross-sector partnership examples](/the-guide-to-cross-sector-collaboration) across five major supply chain challenge areas:

* Supply chain traceability and transparency
* Fair labor/decent work
* Supply chain sustainability initiatives
* Responsible sourcing and procurement
* Sustainability assurance and verification

### Challenge Area: Supply Chain Traceability and Transparency

For most [companies](/who-we-serve/companies), it is difficult to trace the entire supply chain from the first to the last mile. Most companies source ingredients and materials from thousands of suppliers, farmers, or producers and use distributors, agents, or cooperatives who may aggregate products or inputs from thousands of people. This makes transparency a serious challenge. How can companies verify sustainability if they can’t map their supply chain or know how their materials or products get handled each step of the way?  

To help overcome this barrier, cross-sector partners are coming together to develop, pilot, and scale new technologies and approaches to [increase supply chain transparency and traceability](/solutions/supply-chains), from the first mile to the end buyer.

#### Example #1: Cross-Sector Partnerships for Seafood Traceability

To enhance seafood traceability from catch to plate, USAID; MDPI, an Indonesian foundation focused on sustainable fisheries; international seafood supplier Anova Seafood; and an Indonesian tuna processor [partnered to develop and implement an internal traceability system](/project-profiles/usaid-oceans) for use by Indonesian tuna processors—a critical link in global seafood supply chains.

The partners created TraceTales to enable tuna processors to electronically capture, store, and [manage seafood product data](/blog/the-next-big-thing-in-aquaculture-qa). Through the adoption of TraceTales, the local supplier digitizes their entire catch documentation process, tracking seafood products as they move through the value chain. Local suppliers can now meet U.S. Seafood Import Monitoring Program requirements, increase the pace and accuracy of their data capture and business calculations, and reduce product recalls and waste. TraceTales also supports verification of Fair Trade certification.

  
  

### Challenge Area: Fair Labor / Decent Work

  

Modern slavery, labor rights violations, and the inability to secure decent work are rife across global supply chains. According to the United Nations, approximately 25 million people worldwide are victims of forced labor, and the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 5.4 victims of modern slavery for every 1,000 people in the world.

These issues persist, in part, because they can be difficult to detect within sprawling global supply chains. They also span across borders, industries, and supply chains, making it extremely difficult for any one company, NGO, or government to act with systemic impact alone.   

#### Example #2: Cross-Sector Partnerships to Reduce Labor Exploitation

Companies can still play a pivotal role in leading change on these issues. Under the USAID Asia Counter Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) project and the USAID Thailand CTIP project, we helped broker, develop, and implement a range of cross-sector partnerships to engage the private sector to [combat human trafficking in global supply chains.](/blog/fair-labor-for-migrant-workers-in-thailands-seafood-supply-chain)

One notable example: USAID is partnering with Mars Petcare, a leading global pet care provider, to [reduce labor exploitation in the seafood supply chain in Thailand](/project-profiles/usaid-thailand-ctip) and beyond. Partnership activities focus on improving worker voice on fishing vessels at sea, building industry capacity for responsible recruitment, and facilitating broader engagement among the private sector, government, and civil society stakeholders. 

#### Example #3: Cross-Sector Partnerships to Reduce the Vulnerability of Cocoa Farmers

Tony’s Chocolonely, a Dutch chocolate company whose mission is to “make 100% slave free the norm in chocolate,"" created [Tony’s Open Chain](https://www.tonysopenchain.com/the-challenge/), an industry partnership that challenges other chocolate companies and retailers to commit to 5 Sourcing Principles designed to drive industry-level change, eliminate child and human slavery, and pay a livable income to cocoa farmers. 

The 5 Sourcing Principles offer a vision for reducing the vulnerability of cocoa farmers across the industry by calling for:

* Traceable cocoa beans (so companies know the farmers and cooperatives they source from)
* Higher prices for cocoa (to ensure a livable income for farmers)
* Investments in farmers’ organizational capacity and professionalization (to increase their market access and bargaining power)
* 5-year buying commitments
* Support for farmers to undertake productivity, diversification, and quality programs to improve yield.

Tony’s Chocolonely couples these 5 Sourcing Principles with tools and resources to help chocolate industry players make the transition. ALDI Choco Changer, JOKOLADE, Albert Heijn’s Delicata, and Barry Callebaut have all joined or support the challenge. 

### Challenge Area: Supply Chain Sustainability Initiatives

  
  

From advancing sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices to [reducing plastic pollution](/blog/best-practices-to-combat-ocean-plastic) and mitigating carbon emissions across the chain: Complex and ambitious sustainability initiatives demand collaboration and action on the ground. 

[Sustainability teams](/blog/best-practices-for-sustainability-teams) recognize that it’s not enough to just set ambitious sustainability goals or develop strategies. They need on-the-ground adoption from farmers, producers, suppliers, and distributors to make progress. But many of these individuals also produce and sell to multiple outlets, each with their own goals, sustainability standards, and requirements.   

In these cases, for individual companies to make significant progress on sustainability goals, they need to drive system-level change. A key piece of that equation: [Pre-competitive collaboration](/blog/best-practices-to-harness-the-power-of-pre-competitive-collaboration-for-sustainable-supply-chains), in which competitors and companies up and down the chain work together to advance a common goal. 

#### Example #4: Pre-Competitive and Cross-Sector Collaboration to Advance Sustainable Agricultural Supply Chains

A company consortium from The Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) platform—including leading multinational agribusinesses such as PepsiCo and Ingredion—is currently forging pre-competitive and cross-sector partnerships that [advance sustainable agricultural supply chains in Pakistan](/project-profiles/sai). 

We’re currently working with the SAI platform to identify intersecting challenges across multiple company supply chains and to coordinate action and pre-competitive collaboration to [address shared sustainability challenges](/services/sustainable-impact). These companies are considering combining efforts and resources to engage farmers in Pakistan on sustainable agricultural solutions that will benefit each company and the collective system.   

#### Example #5: Cross-Sector Partnership to Eliminate Greenhouse Gas Emissions

In 2017, Walmart launched [Project Gigaton](https://www.walmartsustainabilityhub.com/climate/project-gigaton), in partnership with WWF and other civil society players, to mobilize and engage thousands of Walmart suppliers to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions linked to six pillars: Energy, waste, packaging, agriculture, forests, and product use and design.

The company seeks to eliminate one billion metric tons from its global supply chain—the largest in the world—by 2030.  NGO partners are working with Walmart to design tools for the company’s global supplier network, to help suppliers effectively shift practices to reduce emissions. 

### Challenge Area: Responsible Sourcing and Procurement

For companies, there are many drivers that complicate responsible sourcing and procurement of raw materials and inputs: Sometimes, first-mile producers, such as farmers, extractors, and fisherfolk, lack the resources and training to access sustainable inputs, purchase quality equipment, or apply sustainable methods. Other times, it’s companies that need to make the commitment to (1) source responsibly and (2) potentially pay more.  

#### Example #6: Industry-Wide Collaboration to Advance Responsible Sourcing of Minerals

One approach to level-up responsible sourcing? Industry-wide collaboration. For example, to help drive systemic change, companies are banding together to pool resources and streamline approaches under the [Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)](https://www.responsiblebusiness.org/initiatives/rmi/).

The RMI brings together more than 400 companies in 10 different industries to create a range of tools, resources, and practical guidance to help companies advance responsible sourcing of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. The RMI also works with governments, NGOs, international organizations, and other key stakeholders in mineral supply chains, including via the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals and the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade. 

### Challenge Area: Sustainability Assurance and Verification

Many companies have heavily invested in verification and certification models that identify and reward farmers, producers, and suppliers for using sustainable methods. But when it comes to traditional certification and auditing of individual small-scale producers, these tools often fall short despite significant investments.  

#### Example #7: Partnerships to Accelerate Sustainable Aquaculture Sourcing

To overcome this challenge, cross-sector partners have joined forces to create the [Partnership Assurance Model (PAM)](/partnership-assurance-model-guide) to accelerate sustainable aquaculture improvement and sourcing.

Currently, Resonance is collaborating with Seafood Watch, Chicken of the Sea, Cheesecake Factory, Bon Appetit Management Company, other buyers, and suppliers to use this innovative approach to verify small-scale sustainable aquaculture production at the regional level rather than certifying individual aquaculture farms and operations.

## Deploying Cross-Sector Collaboration for Sustainable Supply Chains

Companies face daunting challenges when it comes to creating an equitable and sustainable supply chain—challenges that are often too big for them to tackle alone.

Whether a company aims to boost resiliency, sustainability, and productivity of its agricultural supply chain; take climate action; combat inequality, or address other labor and sustainability challenges, cross-sector partnerships offer enormous opportunities to make real, lasting progress. By co-investing and taking collective action, companies can realize greater business opportunities while simultaneously driving system-wide evolution.

Source Title: Strategic Sourcing Case Studies 2026 — 10 Real-World Insights
URL: https://procurementtactics.com/strategic-sourcing-case-studies/
Relevant Content: Furthermore, Starbucks implements enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that allow the company to track inventory levels and manage demand. Starbucks’ strategies for sourcing and procurement involve building partnerships with suppliers all over Asia, America, and Latin America. By traveling to meet agents and visit their plants and factories, Starbucks can build strategic relationships with international suppliers.

##### What We Can Learn From It:

Modern developments, combined with changing consumer preferences, present several challenges for companies like Starbucks, whose brand is renowned for specialty products. These challenges stem from the rise of instant products and more affordable products from competitors, which are ideal for everyday consumers. [...] ### Example 7 — Nestlé’s sustainable and economic sourcing strategy

#### Actual Case:

Nestlé confronts challenges in sourcing 100% deforestation-free soy, with responsible sourcing lead Madeleine Eilert citing complex supply networks and legal disputes related to the conversion of cropland as the key challenges in Nestlé’s sourcing strategy. Nestlé’s goal involves creating a supply chain that is 100% deforestation-free, but supply chain complexities may not allow them to have direct contact with farmers. [...] Studying case studies helps procurement professionals understand practical applications of sourcing theories, identify industry best practices, and avoid common pitfalls. They provide actionable insights into how others solved challenges in procurement and supply chain management.

##### How does strategic sourcing differ from traditional procurement?

Strategic sourcing focuses on long-term value, total cost of ownership, and supplier partnerships, whereas traditional procurement often emphasizes short-term cost savings and transactional efficiency. The case studies in this article reflect this shift toward a more strategic, value-driven approach.

Relevant Content: This type of partnership has presented unique challenges for VW and the supplier partners to overcome. A plan of daily meetings, constant communication of all the partners, and the integration of 52 information systems providing immediate data access is used to coordinate their many activities. In order to prevent conflicts between the different staffs, wages and benefits are the same and all employees wear identical uniforms featuring a VW logo and their firm’s logo. Finally, a master craftsperson that takes personal responsibility for the vehicles performs final tests and conduct a pre-delivery functional audit to ensure quality standards and maintain conformity within the production process. [...] Although implementing the modular consortium has produced many challenges, the benefits are noteworthy. By introducing the modular concept, VW’s overall costs are down 15 – 25% and flexibility has increased due to the small number of suppliers. Also, individual customization of orders is made quicker through increased communication and easier decision making. Most importantly, gain sharing rewards of reductions in product defects and order fulfillment times, and improvements in on-time delivery and product performance have been seen throughout the plant. The success of this venture was made possible through planning, communication, and hard work to ensure quality standards – now VW and its supplier partners are reaping rewards through increased revenues.

top [...] At the facility, seven modules are sequentially integrated with each partner occupying a section of the plant and taking full responsibility for the quality control and mounting of complete assemblies. VW approves the final vehicle and the partners only receive payment on this completely finished product, and not on the individual parts as is the normal industry custom. By basically outsourcing the assembly operation, VW not only reduces its assembly labor costs, but is able to focus on logistics, engineering, quality assurance, and customer service.

# Case Studies: Developing Collaborative Supplier Partnerships

## Case Studies

[Dell Computers](#1)  
 [Eric Scott Limited](#2)  
 [Volkswagen Brazil](#3)

h2. Dell Computers ([27](https://scm.ncsu.edu/public/supplierpartner/9conclref.html#22))

Early on Dell Computers recognized the benefits of collaborative supply chain relationships and adopted the practice while developing its “Dell Direct Model” in 1995. This innovative model of efficiency included something the computer industry had never experienced: a high velocity, low cost distribution system with direct customer relationships and build–to–order manufacturing. By instituting collaborative supplier relationships, Dell Computers was able to achieve significant cost savings and maintain a competitive advantage over competitors for several years.

To accomplish this, Dell first pared down its supplier companies from 204 to 47. Then, in order to operate on a just–in–time (JIT) inventory basis, these suppliers warehoused their components only 15 minutes from the Dell factory. This JIT inventory system decreased inventory costs and led to a 6% profit advantage in components which was passed along to consumers, while reducing inventory from 30 to 13 days- well ahead of the industry average at the time of 75 to 100 days. Other advantages of Dell’s JIT system included easier customization of computers to customers’ exact specifications, lessened likelihood of obsolete raw materials, ability to adjust production levels to meet demand, and a finished product ready for shipment just 36 hours after an order was placed.

After a computer was assembled, it was sent to one of Dell’s many contracted shippers. In yet another move to decrease inventory, lower costs, and increase efficiency, Dell had these shippers house the monitors for their computer systems. By email, Dell would notify the appropriate shipper that a system was ready and at the same time the shipper would schedule the monitor for concurrent delivery to the customer. This resulted in a savings of $30 in freight costs per monitor, resulting in another way that Dell could pass on savings to consumers.

Integrated supplier and distributor networks were instrumental in the success of Dell Computers. By using a JIT inventory system, Dell’s inventory turnover time was reduced by 57% and production space expanded due to the decreased storage area needed for inventory. Without these relationships, Dell would not have been able to support a 50+% growth rate for 3 consecutive years that lead to $12 billion in annual sales by 1997.

As a small leather-goods manufacturer, Eric Scott Limited believes in improving supply chain operations through collaboration with suppliers and customers. By switching from a home-grown IT system to Made2Manage Systems’ VIP enterprise portal solution in 1999, Eric Scott Limited has been able to enhance communications with its partners both up- and down stream. Implementation of the system required overcoming suppliers’ issues before the advantages could be reaped.

One major concern of Eric Scott Limited was the protection of their customers’ data and information. To ensure customer privacy, the two companies worked out a sort of “hybrid hosting” where the collaboration servers are hosted by Made2Manage and the customer data is kept behind Scott’s firewall. This managed gateway approach allows for a relatively high degree of collaboration between the two businesses.

An advantage of the Made2Manage system was the ability it offered Scott to communicate through electric data interchange (EDI) with customers and suppliers. Orders come in by EDI where the Made2Manage system schedules them for manufacture and shipment and then sends notification to the customer. Also, this real time data is available on the portal where customers can access the site at any time to check on the status of their orders and pay their invoices on line.

Another benefit of the VIP software is that the system portal provides a collaborative forum for the suppliers. This allows suppliers to check on inventory status with the company and have pre-set reorder points for shipments. The portal also permits customers to exchange virtual design documents and store them, thereby reducing prototypes and the entire timeline from the product’s conception to its delivery.

Collaborative relationships managed through Made2Manage Systems’ software and technology allowed a small company like Eric Scott Limited to add big value in dealings with both suppliers and customers. As Scott expanded into new markets, VIP enterprise portal solutions offered them opportunities to provide additional services around product distribution. From managed gateways and forums for reordering and design development to EDI capabilities that schedule manufacture and shipment of orders, send customer notifications, provide 24 – hour online order checking and invoice payment options, Eric Scott Limited’s adoption of partnership collaboration techniques and use of technology have ensured benefits for all involved.

h2. Volkswagen Brazil ([29](https://scm.ncsu.edu/public/supplierpartner/9conclref.html#29))

In 1997, Volkswagen (VW) implemented the modular consortium concept of supply chain management at its new assembly complex in their Brazilian plant. In order to for this concept to be successful, VW first had to drastically reduce its number of suppliers from 400 to only 8. Then, these 8 suppliers were invited to locate their bases of operations at the VW Brazil plant where they were provided with their own offices and staffs. In addition, VW asked them to each invest an additional $50 million in their respective modules. For agreeing to this investment and sharing of risk, the partners were guaranteed long-term contracts from 5 to 15 years.

At the facility, seven modules are sequentially integrated with each partner occupying a section of the plant and taking full responsibility for the quality control and mounting of complete assemblies. VW approves the final vehicle and the partners only receive payment on this completely finished product, and not on the individual parts as is the normal industry custom. By basically outsourcing the assembly operation, VW not only reduces its assembly labor costs, but is able to focus on logistics, engineering, quality assurance, and customer service.

This type of partnership has presented unique challenges for VW and the supplier partners to overcome. A plan of daily meetings, constant communication of all the partners, and the integration of 52 information systems providing immediate data access is used to coordinate their many activities. In order to prevent conflicts between the different staffs, wages and benefits are the same and all employees wear identical uniforms featuring a VW logo and their firm’s logo. Finally, a master craftsperson that takes personal responsibility for the vehicles performs final tests and conduct a pre-delivery functional audit to ensure quality standards and maintain conformity within the production process.

Although implementing the modular consortium has produced many challenges, the benefits are noteworthy. By introducing the modular concept, VW’s overall costs are down 15 – 25% and flexibility has increased due to the small number of suppliers. Also, individual customization of orders is made quicker through increased communication and easier decision making. Most importantly, gain sharing rewards of reductions in product defects and order fulfillment times, and improvements in on-time delivery and product performance have been seen throughout the plant. The success of this venture was made possible through planning, communication, and hard work to ensure quality standards – now VW and its supplier partners are reaping rewards through increased revenues.

# 24 Ways to Reduce the Cost of Production

[Abby Jenkins](/portal/resource/authors/abby-jenkins.shtml)  | Product
Marketing Manager

One of the most successful ways that manufacturers can improve their profitability and their
business viability is by reducing the cost of production. Production costs are the all-in
expenses it takes for a manufacturer to make goods and bring them to market. Because there
are so many cost inputs at even the smallest of manufacturers, figuring out how to minimize
spending can seem daunting. But through effective technology investments that deliver
visibility and coordinated management centered on industry-proven best practices, such as
lean manufacturing, manufacturers can lower their production costs. The following guide
explores some of the most common ways to accomplish this goal.

## What Are Production Costs?

Production costs, also known as the cost of production, refer to the total expenses incurred
by a company to manufacture and bring a product or service to market. These costs are
essential for management to understand as they directly impact the pricing, profitability
and competitive positioning of the company’s offerings. Production costs can be broadly
categorized into direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs are those that can
unquestionably be attributed to the production process, including raw materials and the
labor involved in manufacturing. Indirect costs, or overhead costs, aren’t clearly tied to
the production process but are necessary for operations, such as rent, utilities and
administrative staff.

Understanding production costs is crucial for businesses as they strategize to minimize
expenses and maximize efficiency. These costs are a key factor in determining the break-even
point — the price point at which a product must be sold to cover its production costs. By
analyzing and optimizing production costs, manufacturers can make informed decisions about
pricing, investment in production technology and process improvements. This can lead to more
competitive pricing for consumers and better margins for the company, ultimately affecting
the business’s bottom line.

Key Takeaways

* The cost of production in manufacturing includes all of the direct manufacturing costs,
  manufacturing overhead and indirect expenses necessary to bring goods to market.
* Lean manufacturing principles that reduce waste across both materials and processes play
  a huge part in reducing production costs.
* Manufacturers can also drive down production costs through optimized design of products
  and packaging geared toward reducing raw materials and labor needed for assembly,
  including standardizing on parts wherever possible.
* Investing in automation and technology can help speed up production and offer visibility
  into processes, allowing manufacturers to continue to improve efficiency and reduce
  waste.

## 24 Ways to Reduce the Cost of Production

Because the cost of production includes such a variety of different cost inputs, there are
many ways manufacturers can start bringing it down. However, since cost of production is a
big-picture metric, companies must coordinate the simultaneous execution of myriad
strategies over time in order to truly make a dent in production costs. This coordination
serves as the basis of [manufacturing cost
management](/portal/resource/articles/accounting/manufacturing-cost-management.shtml), which considers all of the levers described below to lower the cost of
production and boost profitability.

1. ### Negotiate With Suppliers

   Effective supplier negotiation and strong [supplier
   relationship management practices](/portal/resource/articles/erp/supplier-relationship-management-srm.shtml) can yield tremendous savings on production
   costs,
   and manufacturers will build a more resilient supply chain in the process.
   Manufacturers can
   bring down costs by negotiating preferred contracts that guarantee certain volumes
   over time
   to lock in lower prices. They can also craft supplier contracts that guarantee
   exclusivity
   to certain suppliers in exchange for price breaks, or they can ink deals with a
   broader
   range of regional suppliers that could reduce distribution costs. Ultimately,
   there’s a lot
   of room for creativity and deal-making on this front to save money and reduce risks
   that
   could ultimately impinge on the bottom line.
2. ### Implement Lean Manufacturing

   Lean manufacturing practices can help businesses slash production costs by limiting
   overproduction and reducing idle time. Lean manufacturing also helps manufacturers
   cut
   the
   cost of raw materials by minimizing defects or purchasing mistakes. Industry studies
   show
   that, on average, a manufacturer can reduce costs by anywhere from 5% to 20% in the
   first
   year alone after implementing lean manufacturing practices. And those savings aren’t
   to
   the
   detriment of finished products — in fact, lean manufacturing generally improves
   quality
   management metrics, such as defect reduction, by anywhere from 25% to 90%.
3. ### Optimize Energy Use

   Energy prices are outstripping broader inflation rates, and manufacturers would do
   well
   to
   get ahead of these costs by optimizing their energy use, which will help bring down
   production costs. This optimization starts with regular energy audits to identify
   inefficiencies in factory machinery and facilities equipment and prioritize
   investments.
   Some obvious ways to move the needle on energy use is through technology, such as
   LED
   lighting, high-efficiency motors and green heating, ventilation and air conditioning
   (HVAC)
   systems. Similarly, automated facilities and plant management systems that lean on
   Industrial Internet of Things telemetry and advanced analytics to minimize energy
   waste
   during idle times can help manufacturers reduce consumption and drive down energy
   costs.
4. ### Minimize Waste

   Cutting waste can reduce production costs across a number of fronts. One of the most
   obvious
   is the reduction of disposal costs. By minimizing their waste streams, manufacturers
   spend
   less on logistics, transportation and storage of garbage, scrap and hazardous
   byproducts. On
   top of that, reducing waste cuts down on the cost of raw materials that go into
   making a
   product in the first place. Waste isn’t just a materials play, either. Implementing
   lean
   manufacturing principles, including just-in-time production, optimized equipment and
   service
   schedules and streamlined processes, eliminates overproduction, excess inventory and
   unnecessary movement, leading to significant cost savings. Additionally, recycling
   manufacturing waste avoids landfill tipping fees and can even generate revenue
   through
   selling recyclable materials, such as cardboard, further reducing operational
   expenses.
5. ### Manage Inventory Effectively

   Effective [inventory
   management](/portal/resource/articles/inventory-management/inventory-management.shtml)
   can help organizations reduce production costs through savings across the entire
   product
   life cycle. For example, [adequately managing raw materials](/portal/resource/articles/inventory-management/raw-material-management.shtml) and ensuring that stock
   is at
   the
   right place at the right time keeps bottlenecks from slowing production cycles down.
   Meanwhile, strong forecasting and well-planned distribution of finished inventory
   ensure
   availability without overburdening the manufacturer with excess stock that ties up
   cash,
   and
   they also decrease the risk of waste through stale inventory that becomes obsolete.
   Finally,
   whether for raw materials, works in process or finished products, inventory
   management
   helps
   organizations trim storage costs by optimizing the amount of inventory on hand.
6. ### Utilize Space Efficiently

   Real-estate costs are baked into production costs, so getting the most out of rented
   or
   owned
   space is a real concern for manufacturers seeking to manage costs. The goal should
   be to
   design facilities that optimize storage and squeeze utility out of every inch of
   property
   that the manufacturer pays for each month. Arguably even more crucial is
   understanding
   that
   the [layout of
   warehouses](/portal/resource/articles/erp/warehouse-layout.shtml) and factory plants
   often
   have a direct correlation to operational productivity and effectiveness.
   Manufacturers
   that
   design layouts that support streamlined workflows and minimize bottlenecks are able
   to
   improve margins over the long haul.
7. ### Enhance Workforce Efficiency

   Establishing processes and tools for workforce management can help manufacturers get
   more
   from their workers across factory floors, warehouses and distribution facilities.
   For
   instance, tweaking operational workflows and shift scheduling to reflect accurate
   demand
   forecasting can help bolster workforce efficiency, as can effective training for
   employees
   to ensure that they’re operating at peak performance. Many manufacturers today turn
   to
   automated back-office solutions that feature labor optimization powered by [artificial
   intelligence](/portal/resource/articles/erp/ai-in-manufacturing.shtml) (AI) to
   juggle
   factors such as skills in demand, budgeted hours, customer demand and concerns about
   regulatory compliance regarding labor. This leads to optimal schedules that balance
   labor
   demand with budgetary and market realities.
8. ### Automate Processes

   Since the advent of the assembly line, manufacturers have been on the front lines of
   automation to achieve efficiency and cost savings. Manufacturing automation has now
   entered
   an era of hyperautomation, where a complex web of digital technologies, including
   advanced
   analytics, robotics and AI, are woven together across IT, operational technology and
   engineering technology to maximize the profitability of workflows and to bridge
   silos
   across
   functional areas. In this world of hyperautomation, back-office analytics examining
   customer
   trends result in advanced forecasting that automatically triggers changes in
   inventory
   management and production scheduling based on real-time data. This helps
   manufacturers
   keep
   costs down in quiet periods without losing their ability to appropriately supply
   customers
   with the goods they need, when they need them. Industry watchers say that using
   composability for automation is the way to go here. Composability is the use of
   modular
   components that are part of a well-integrated system of hyperautomation. Analysts
   say
   that
   manufacturers that move to composability in the next few years stand to save 50% on
   the
   total cost of ownership of their automated systems.
9. ### Conduct Audits Regularly

   Audits aren’t purely a regulatory compliance or quality assurance tool. Conducting
   regular
   checks, such as energy audits, manufacturing process audits, waste audits and [supply chain
   audits](/portal/resource/articles/erp/supply-chain-audit.shtml), can help
   manufacturers
   find opportunities to improve operations that help slim down production costs. For
   example,
   manufacturing process audits can reveal bottlenecks or workflow issues that could be
   addressed by resequencing operations or standardizing procedures to bolster
   productivity.
   Similarly, regular inventory management audits could help a company eliminate excess
   inventory and reduce carrying costs. When done right, the results of regular audits
   can
   serve as cost management roadmaps.
10. ### Improve Processes Continuously

    In manufacturing, sometimes the smallest improvements can spur the biggest savings
    over
    time.
    This is why continuous improvement stands as a key component of the most popular
    manufacturing management frameworks — be it lean manufacturing, total quality
    management
    or
    just-in-time inventory management. Smart manufacturers take input from audits,
    factory
    telemetry, consumer surveys and employee feedback to search constantly for small
    ways to
    optimize processes and tweak designs. The culture of continuous improvement favors
    incremental changes and easily reversible experiments that don’t introduce too much
    risk
    to
    the organization, making it possible to minimize waste without threatening
    productivity
    or
    product quality.
11. ### Design Products Efficiently

    Designing products with ease of fabrication and assembly top of mind can lead to
    significant
    production cost savings. To accomplish this, manufacturers should choose materials
    that
    balance performance with cost and consider parts reduction and standardization
    wherever
    possible. Designing products efficiently can help manufacturers slash their material
    expenses, cut down on assembly time and save on labor costs. It can also help lower
    capital
    expenses by reducing the need for specialized factory tooling in certain instances.
    Additionally, simplifying the parts list can help lower the risk of defects over
    time;
    fewer
    moving parts mean fewer places something can break. One of the most common ways to
    improve
    efficiency through design is by adhering to design for manufacturability principles,
    a
    set
    of industry engineering practices for designing with manufacturing cost in mind.
    Manufacturers are also increasingly using generative AI to develop simulation models
    and
    optimize design. In fact, some estimates indicate that by 2027 33% of new product
    and
    asset
    designs will use generative AI, compared to less than 5% in 2023.
12. ### Standardize Parts

    The standardization of parts can be a game-changer for manufacturing cost management.
    Standardization cuts down on the number of components manufacturers need, making
    procurement
    more straightforward and simplifying both purchasing and inventory management. Less
    variety
    in purchases makes it easier to negotiate better bulk discounts and generally
    promotes
    more
    economies of scale in production. When production lines deal with fewer parts,
    assembly
    becomes easier and more efficient and defect rates go down. Additionally,
    maintenance
    and
    repair are more cost-effective, as parts are more accessible and easier to track
    down
    across
    the organization, limiting wait time for parts.
13. ### Streamline Marketing Efforts

    According to recent figures, manufacturing firms spend an average of 13% of their
    overall
    budgets on marketing expenses. As organizations seek to reduce overhead expenses,
    which
    include production costs, they would do well to put a microscope on marketing costs.
    Marketing is a tricky line item because, when done right, it’s part of the revenue
    generation engine and a necessary component of successfully driving growth. The goal
    here is
    to take a closer look at marketing analytics and the data that tracks the return on
    investment (ROI) of marketing initiatives. Using a data-driven approach to
    marketing,
    manufacturers can start to jettison less productive marketing expenses and target
    investments on the marketing activities that drive the highest value to the
    business.
14. ### Negotiate Utility Rates

    Manufacturers can reduce their production costs by doing a better job actively
    managing
    their
    utilities supply chain. One of the most obvious ways to do this is by negotiating
    better
    rates with energy or fuel providers — for example, by locking in rates for specified
    periods
    of time over the course of a long-term contract. Another opportunity to lower costs
    is
    to
    negotiate lower pricing for buying off-demand energy during quieter times on the
    grid,
    when
    a manufacturer can run its line outside standard business hours.
15. ### Rationalize the Product Line

    Rationalizing a product line helps manufacturers cut back on the number of products
    they
    make
    so they can focus on the goods they’re best at delivering. Manufacturers engaging in
    rationalization typically aim to eliminate high-cost, low-margin products that may
    not
    be
    generating a lot of value for customers. Similarly, they’re on the hunt for
    redundant
    products. These actions can help manufacturers ease complexity problems and cut
    costs by
    reducing setup times, improving economies of scale and slashing overhead expenses
    around
    storage and distribution. A well-rationalized product line is one that gets the most
    out
    of
    a manufacturer’s existing resources and maximizes profitability in the process.
16. ### Cut Overhead Costs

    Manufacturing [overhead costs](/portal/resource/articles/accounting/how-to-calculate-overhead.shtml)
    include
    all
    of the indirect expenses that go into producing products, including utilities,
    facility
    maintenance, depreciation and administrative expenses. Companies that are ruthless
    about
    finding ways to cut overhead are the ones that maximize their margins. Whether it’s
    through
    sweeping measures, such as lean manufacturing initiatives, or taking small steps,
    such
    as
    improving maintenance practices to increase the lifespan of machinery, every dollar
    saved on
    overhead makes a dent in overall production costs. One of the most dramatic ways
    that
    manufacturers can drive down overhead is by streamlining manual back-office
    functions
    through technology investments that automate tedious busy work and enhance data
    analytics at
    the same time.
17. ### Restructure Products

    Redesigning or reconfiguring the way a product is built can help simplify expensive
    manufacturing processes and potentially lower materials costs. For example,
    manufacturers
    that continually reevaluate materials and product features — particularly for
    products
    with
    high manufacturing and raw material costs — can often reap consistent gains on
    margins
    over
    time. In order to do this well and maintain customer satisfaction, manufacturers
    need to
    balance innovation in materials science and cost-savings measures with quality
    targets,
    keeping a close eye on customer satisfaction data as they make tweaks. While cost
    savings
    are the ideal, manufacturers have to be mindful that they don’t diminish their
    products’
    value propositions.
18. ### Lower Labor Costs

    High labor costs can quickly eat into a manufacturer’s profits. Recent studies show
    that
    while [manufacturing labor](/portal/resource/articles/accounting/calculate-labor-cost-manufacturing.shtml) costs have stopped skyrocketing the way they did a couple
    of
    years
    ago, they still increased 4.2% over the last year. Manufacturers can take a number
    of
    measures to drive down the cost of labor. For example, automation and continuous
    process
    improvement make it possible to get more done with fewer employees. Meantime,
    flexible
    work
    arrangements, including part-time schedules or job sharing, can help companies
    adjust
    staffing levels and minimize idle time during periods of lower activity.
    Cross-training
    and
    upskilling employees can limit dependency on expensive specialized employees, while
    performance incentives and reward systems can motivate employees to boost their
    productivity.
19. ### Streamline Production Processes

    Streamlining production processes can bring down production costs by enhancing
    overall
    operational efficiency and decreasing cycle times and defects. This can be achieved
    through
    standardized workflows and efficient facility layout designs that reduce bottlenecks
    and
    improve materials flow. Similarly

the production cost that we face in most of the production facilities I'm going to give you some examples and then I'm going to give you some cost based recommendations about all those production costs these will be recommendations just to give you a hinch of an idea uh so in the future you may want to use or may want May May or you you don't want to use them it's up to you in the future and there will be a question and answering at the end of the webinar but since I have uh turned on your ability about microphone and camera so you if you want to shoot any question just shoot them right now right away okay so I asked chat GPT what what is cost reduction in manufacturing and it gave me a funny answer it's like it's the taste of a secret source of turning no we can't afford that to yes we can build a roet powered couch so what we are going to do by cost reduction is find the opportunities that is uh making us spend more money on any kind of cost and prevent them so what are production costs if you take a look at a balance sheet of a company there are main five sometimes six sometimes seven or you can have some uh subcategories as well uh but these are the main categories of production cost First of them is material any kind of material for example you are buying steel you're buying cotton you're buying Fabrics you are buying uh some materials uh so you can combine them in your production in your assembly line or any semi-finish Goods which we are going to call them whip working in progress material most of the time these material cost will come up to 60 or 70% of your cost of your company of your operations in the second we can name energy by meaning energy we can say electricity natural gas steam water and there's also labor which can be direct labor which will be your operators and indirect labor which will be your white color people most of the time and then we have consumables like oils or gasket bolts or packaging material that you use in your production line uh and also Transportation like internal transportations like agbs or uh Fork list or external Transportation like trucks ships and planes so all of them all five of them can be seen in most of the production facilities so let's see what type of activities we can do to decrease those production cost First let's start with material uh by meaning material what I mean is raw materials first semi-finish Goods or whips uh or finished products that we use to produce a product of your company so as I said before most of the time this takes around 60 to 70% of your cost so it's huge so we need to find solutions to use your raw material in your facility in a very efficient way so what do we use what type of activities can we use for example first we need we are buying those M materials so we can use use price forecasting methodologies what we can do as price forecasting is by just collecting the data price data and the inputs that has an effect on price data we can do a regression time series analysis or using machine learning methodologies we can forecast the pricing of those raw materials uh so we can buy the product at the right time which is very good because if you can predict the pricing of that raw material uh when you buy the product at the right time the effects of the increasing prices will be less for your company for the second one is the quantity optimization if we can also bu using the data of your material and the data of how often they are used how often they are uh used in the produ production facilities by using that data we can optimiz your inventories as well what I mean by that is maybe you know lean met maybe you know lean weights or mudas one of the mudas is actually inventory and inventory is as I said before it takes six to 70% of your cost breakdown so using inventory actually it's a must because if the process speeds are different between each processes then you must have inventory in your factory or in your production facility so having an inventory actually helps your company but if you have an inventory more than required it will have some down effects on your company like first of all a financial effect and then there will be a lead time effect as well because inventory doesn't move inside the company you have to move the products or inventories as quick as possible so at the end you will be able to invoice them to your clients and get your money so that's why we can use some quantity optimization methods like still lean 6 Sigma or regression methods methods uh to decrease the quantity of the inventories third one identification of inventory actually it's the First Fundamental thing you need to do we need to actually tag or identify every inventory inside the production facility from raw material to VIPs to uh finish good as well we need to be able to like in three seconds we'll be able to Define where is my inventory and how much of that inventory I have right now in 3 seconds so that's an important fundamental thing to do then for the whips we can use lean methodologies like uh SMS to decrease the downtime that is taking us for not producing that working progress inventory uh also you can use LINE balancing methodologies so by using lean methodologies you can balance the speeds of the processes for example if one process is working faster than the other process there's always an inventory between those processes so by using line balancing methodologies like we do in lean6 Sigma you can balance those processes and decrease the amounts of whips also you can use pool systems so by using pool systems you don't consume more than required or you don't produce more than required finished goods so those are the activities that you can do to decrease your material cost next energy by meaning energy I'm talking about natur gas steam hot water cold water air or electricity so what we can do to decrease energy cost in a company of course first one is energy leaks because if there are energy leaks in a furnace for example or energy leaks uh through a pipe so if you're sending that air outside of pipe or steam outside of pipe or water outside of pipe or sending the uh hot air or cold hair outside of the Furnace then that means that that's you have an energy leaks so you're paying for uh leaks actually so first one you need to do is insulations actually to get rid of the energy leaks second one is by using optimization methods like regression or machine learning by collecting the data that consumes energy like the furnaces as I said or or the coolers you can uh find the optimum process parameters to run those machines or equipment so by using that you can uh decrease your energy consumption in a very good levels one of the most energy com uh energy using equipment is actually compressive are actually compressors and with the compressors if you can collect compressor data as well by using machine learning or regression methods or currently there are some companies that uh use iot systems to collect that data and by collecting that data they use also machine learning uh apps softwares so by that you can be able to improve the compressor and Energy Efficiency as well that that's a very good approach uh up to 10 to 15% which is a very good uh ratio actually you can use also statistical process control but uh this time I'm talking about not the regular conventional statistical process control I'm talking about realtime statistical process control softwares by using realtime statistical process control methodology and software you can find the signals that are coming from your processes that are consuming energy so you will build able to modify the machine process parameters so you you don't need to spend a lot of energy with that and also for the energy prices by using machine learning algorithms you can forecast the energy prices as well these are the examples that we had done in the the past for the labor by meaning labor I'm also talking about direct and indirect labor so it's also blue color and white color Personnel that are working for your company what we can do is first of course trainings I mean we need to train our people to do their job in the most highest uh ability so we need to take actions to give the necessary trainings and documents to those people that's a fundamental thing you need to do that's an ISO 9,000 uh rule actually a regulation second one you can use 5S Smith and kakuri kaizens like lean Improvement activities to increase the productivity of those people uh you will never believe what type of improvements you can get with those and also this is the digitalization area right now uh we you can Auto you can make them autonomous by using robots Cobalts or AG Technologies so as I said mudas in the beginning uh movement is also a muda or Transportation also as a muda so by using those digital Technologies like robots and AGS even drones you can do those activities by machines not only people as well you can use poke solutions to prevent mistakes uh for the uh labor cost also use BPM business process management or business process automation softwares uh think about that if you are doing your job on your computers by Exel and outlooks for example you prepare a report and then collect uh copy that report to Outlook and send it as an email if you do activities like that this is also taking so much time so much of your labor cost by using BPM softwares uh you can increase the efficiency as well and also RPA robotic process automation if you have frequently repetitive computer activities in your company for example you have to get the data from your invoices like the pricing data date data and the item data and then copy that information to an Exel sheet or copy that to an information to your Erp system if you are doing that repetitively every day it takes a lot of uh indirect time FTE uh to be able to increase the efficiency of that you can use RPA systems as well consumables actually all the materials that you use in the assembly line or Oils paines bolts whatever you are you're using as an consumables are also some part of cost to decrease the consumable cost we you can use still regression methods or machine learning methods so you can optimize the use of of those consumables and also you can by using those activities uh you can optimize the quantity also of those consumables so you don't have to keep a lot of inventories of your consumables for some companies consumables are as similar as raw material cost as well because of the for example assemble lines can have like that also one fundamental thing to do if you're are doing 5S or image processing as well can be used as well you need to identify all your inventories for your consumables as well for the transportation I think this is the last one uh any type of vehicles used to displacement of material and people can be talk as Transportation so what do we have as Transportation cost for example you can use Six Sigma methodologies or route optim imization softwares to optimize your fuel usage uh you know the fuel prices are very high right now in Turkey so that's a very much if you have a lot of uh trucks that are going to your country going to your clients and your suppliers you need to optimize those trucks and other equipment that are carrying your inventory by using route optimization and Six Sigma you can get enormous uh improve from that also you can use by using some softwares you can optimize the occupancy of your transport Vehicles so for example let's think about your truck can get 100 boxes if you are sending that truck with 89 boxes then you're not using Optimum optimally your truck so using those kind of softwares can help that uh and for the last of it by using using reliability analysis you can be able to analyze the life of your equipment Services what what do I mean by that for example you are in a gold mine and you are using uh tires which will cost $50,000 per piece so let's think about that you have 300 trucks every truck has six tires and uh you can if you multiply it by uh 6 * 50 which is 300,000 per truck uh and if you multiply it by 300 again I think it's around one 1 million or 10 million something like that it's a lot of Transportation uh cost what you can do is by calculating the reliability of your tires you can let that company use those tires which is around 6,000 hours more than 6,000 hours of those ties so they can also decrease cost by using reliability softwares so these are our addresses and email addresses thank you for your listening I will be happy to answer your questions so you can just shoot it okay if no questions then I'm going to stop recording

# Abstract 

This study examines the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on supply chain operations through a 

comparative analysis of traditional versus AI -enabled processes. The research evaluates five four operational areas: 

efficiency and cost redu ction, decision -making, supply chain visibility, and customer experience. Findings demonstrate 

that AI -driven systems achieve superior performance, delivering 20 -30% improvements in demand forecasting 

accuracy, 25 -40% fewer disruptions compared to convent ional methods. The analysis highlights AI's ability to enable 

real -time, data -driven decision -making and end -to -end supply chain transparency through technologies like IoT, 

machine learning, and blockchain. However, the study identifies significant adoptio n barriers including high 

implementation costs, data integration challenges, workforce skill gaps, and evolving regulatory requirements. Strategic 

recommendations are proposed to overcome these hurdles, including phased implementation approaches, data 

infr astructure modernization, workforce upskilling programs, and ethical AI governance frameworks. The paper also 

discusses critical policy considerations and future research directions, particularly in generative AI applications, 

autonomous supply networks, a nd sustainability optimization. As global supply chains face increasing complexity, this 

research suggests AI adoption is transitioning from competitive advantage to operational necessity. The study 

concludes that organizations which successfully implement AI while addressing adoption challenges will gain 

significant resilience, responsiveness, and cost advantages in an increasingly digital and volatile global marketplace. 

The findings provide valuable insights for practitioners seeking to harness AI's pote ntial while navigating 

implementation complexities in supply chain transformation.

# 1 Introduction 

Supply chain operations are the backbone of global commerce, ensuring the efficient movement of goods from suppliers 

to consumers (Vidrová, 2020). Traditional supply chain management (SCM) relies on manual processes, historical data, 

and human decision -making, which of ten lead to inefficiencies, delays, and increased costs (Wu et al., 2025). With the 

rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), businesses are increasingly adopting AI -driven solutions to enhance 

supply chain visibility, optimize logistics, and impr ove demand forecasting. This paper examines the transformative World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 202 5, 27 (02 ), 1688 -1700

impact of AI on supply chain operations by comparing traditional methods with AI -enabled processes, highlighting key 

benefits, challenges, and future implications. 

1.1. Background on Supply Chain Operations 

Supply chains encompass procurement, production, warehousing, transportation, and distribution (Slam et al., 2023). 

Traditional SCM depends on static planning models, which struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions, demand 

fluctuations, and disruption s such as pandemics or geopolitical crises. The lack of real -time data integration and reliance 

on manual interventions often result in inefficiencies, excess inventory, and poor responsiveness (Abhulimen et al., 

2024). 

Traditional supply chain management (SCM) faces several limitations that hinder efficiency and responsiveness. Manual 

tracking and documentation processes often result in human errors and delays, disrupting workflow (Abhulimen et al., 

2024). Demand forecas ting remains inefficient due to reliance on historical data rather than real -time analytics, leading 

to inaccurate predictions. Additionally, traditional SCM lacks advanced predictive capabilities, weakening risk 

management and leaving supply chains vulner able to disruptions (Khedr and Sheeja, 2024). These inefficiencies 

contribute to high operational costs, as businesses struggle with overstocking or stockouts due to poor inventory 

optimization. These challenges highlight the need for smarter, data -driven solutions to enhance supply chain 

performance. 

1.2. The Rise of AI in Supply Chain Optimization 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management (SCM) through advanced technologies like machine 

learning (ML), predictive analytics, robotic process automation (RPA), and the Internet of Things (IoT) (Mohammed et 

al., 2025). These inn ovations enable predictive demand forecasting by analyzing real -time data, improving accuracy in 

inventory planning (Douaioui et al., 2024). Automated inventory management minimizes waste and optimizes stock 

levels, while AI -powered logistics routing dynam ically adjusts to factors like traffic and weather for efficient deliveries. 

Additionally, AI enhances security through blockchain integration and anomaly detection, reducing fraud and mitigating 

risks (Ali and Mustafa, 2025). By leveraging these capabilit ies, businesses achieve greater efficiency, cost savings, and 

resilience in their supply chain operation. 

1.3. Research Problem and Significance of the Study 

Despite AI’s growing adoption, many firms remain hesitant due to implementation costs, data privacy concerns, and 

workforce resistance. This study addresses the gap in comparative research between traditional and AI -driven supply 

chains, providing insights into operational efficiencies, cost savings, and scalability. 

This study aims to: 

• Compare the performance of traditional vs. AI -enabled supply chain processes. 

• Assess the benefits and challenges of AI adoption in SCM. 

• Examine real -world case studies of successful AI integration. 

Key research questions include: 

• How does AI improve supply chain efficiency compared to traditional methods? 

• What barriers hinder AI adoption in SCM? 

• What are the long -term implications of AI -driven supply chains? 

This paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 examines literature on traditional and AI -driven supply chain 

management. Section 3 outlines the research methodology, while Section 4 conducts a comparative analysis. Finally, 

Section 5 presents key fi ndings, discusses their implications, and suggests future research directions. 

# 2 Literature Review 

2.1. Traditional Supply Chain Operations 

Traditional supply chain operations refer to conventional methods of managing the flow of goods, information, and 

finances across procurement, production, warehousing, and distribution networks (Mufutau and Mojisola, 2013). These 

systems are typically line ar, relying on manual processes, static planning models, and historical data rather than real -World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 202 5, 27 (02 ), 1688 -1700

time insights. Key characteristics include sequential workflows, paper -based documentation, and human -dependent 

decision -making, which often result in delays, inefficiencies, and limited adaptability to disruptions (Čolaković, et al., 

2023). 

One of the most significant challenges in traditional supply chain management (SCM) is manual tracking and 

documentation, which increases the risk of errors, miscommunication, and delays (Amin and Kaur, 2024). Without 

automated systems, businesses struggle with inaccurate inventory records, misplaced shipments, and inefficient order 

processing. Add itionally, inefficient demand forecasting remains a persistent issue, as traditional methods depend on 

past sales data rather than predictive analytics (Khedr and Sheeja, 2024). This leads to overstocking or stockouts, 

increasing carrying costs or lost sal es opportunities. 

Another critical limitation is the lack of real -time data integration, preventing supply chain managers from making 

timely, informed decisions (Lechler et al., 2019). Traditional SCM often operates in silos, with poor visibility across 

suppliers, manufactu rers, and distributors. This disconnect results in poor risk management, as companies cannot 

proactively respond to disruptions such as supplier delays, demand spikes, or logistical bottlenecks. Furthermore, high 

operational costs stem from redundant proce sses, excess inventory, and labor -intensive tasks that could otherwise be 

optimized through automation (Khedr and Sheeja, 2024). 

These challenges highlight the growing need for modernization in supply chain operations. While traditional methods 

have been the foundation of global trade for decades, their inefficiencies in today’s fast -paced, data -driven economy 

underscore the necessi ty for advanced solutions, particularly AI -driven technologies, to enhance accuracy, agility, and 

cost -effectiveness in supply chain management 

2.2. AI in Supply Chain Management 

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into supply chain management (SCM) has revolutionized traditional 

operations by introducing advanced capabilities that enhance efficiency, accuracy, and responsiveness. Key AI 

applications transforming SCM in clude machine learning (ML), predictive analytics, automation, the Internet of Things 

(IoT), and blockchain. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast datasets to identify patterns, enabling more accurate 

demand forecasting and inventory optimization. Predi ctive analytics leverages historical and real -time data to 

anticipate market fluctuations, supplier delays, and potential disruptions, allowing proactive decision -making. 

Automation, powered by AI -driven robotics and robotic process automation (RPA), strea mlines repetitive tasks such as 

order processing, warehouse management, and logistics coordination, reducing human error and operational costs. IoT 

devices provide real -time tracking of goods, monitoring conditions like temperature and humidity for perisha ble items, 

while blockchain ensures transparency and security in transactions through immutable, decentralized ledgers. 

The benefits of AI in supply chain optimization are substantial. Enhanced demand forecasting minimizes overstocking 

and stockouts, improving inventory turnover and reducing waste. Automated logistics routing dynamically adjusts 

delivery paths based on real -time factors like traffic and weather, cutting transportation costs and delays. Improved 

supplier relationship management is achieved through AI -powered risk assessment tools that evaluate supplier 

reliability and market conditions. Additionally, fraud de tection and quality control are strengthened via AI -driven 

anomaly detection and computer vision systems that inspect products for defects. By integrating these technologies, 

businesses achieve end -to -end visibility, operational agility, and cost efficienc y, making AI a cornerstone of modern, 

resilient supply chains. 

As AI continues to evolve, its applications in SCM are expected to expand further, driving innovations such as 

autonomous warehouses, self -adjusting supply networks, and AI -powered procurement negotiations. The 

transformative potential of AI positions it a s an indispensable tool for overcoming the limitations of traditional supply 

chain models and achieving sustainable competitive advantage. 

2.3. Overview of Prior Research on AI Adoption in Supply Chains 

The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain management (SCM) has been extensively studied, 

with researchers examining its adoption patterns, implementation challenges, and measurable impacts. Prior studies 

highlight that AI adop tion in supply chains has accelerated due to increasing global competition, supply chain 

disruptions, and the need for real -time decision -making. Research by Gupta et al. (2021) found that early adopters of AI 

in logistics and inventory management achieved a 15 -30% reduction in operational costs, along with improved delivery 

accuracy. Similarly, a case study on Amazon’s AI -driven warehousing systems demonstrated a 40% increase in 

efficiency through robotic automation and machine learning -based demand foreca sting (Johnson & Lee, 2022). World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 202 5, 27 (02 ), 1688 -1700 

1691 

However, academic literature also identifies key barriers to AI adoption in SCM. A survey by McKinsey (2023) revealed 

that 60% of firms face challenges related to data quality and integration, as AI models require clean, structured, and 

real -time data to f unction effectively. Additionally, high implementation costs and a lack of skilled personnel hinder 

widespread adoption, particularly among small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) (Chen & Wang, 2022). Resistance 

to change within organizational culture fu rther complicates AI integration, as employees often distrust automated 

decision -making systems (Taylor et al., 2021). Despite these obstacles, research suggests that companies overcoming 

these barriers gain significant competitive advantages, including en hanced supply chain resilience and customer 

satisfaction. 

Recent studies also explore sector -specific AI applications. In manufacturing, AI -powered predictive maintenance has 

reduced machine downtime by up to 50%, while in retail, dynamic pricing algorithms have optimized profit margins by 

adjusting prices in rea l time based on demand fluctuations (Kumar & Zhang, 2023). Blockchain -AI integrations have 

also gained attention for improving traceability in food and pharmaceutical supply chains, ensuring compliance with 

safety standards (OECD, 2023). 

Looking ahead, scholars emphasize the need for scalable AI solutions tailored to diverse industries, along with ethical 

frameworks to address data privacy and algorithmic bias concerns (WEF, 2023). Future research directions include the 

role of generative AI in supplier negotiations and the potential for autonomous supply chains requiring minimal human 

intervention. Collectively, prior research underscores AI’s transformative potential in SCM while advocating for 

strategic, inclusive adoption approaches to maximize benefits across global supply networks. 

# 3 Research Methodology 

This study employs a qualitative research design based on a comprehensive literature review to compare traditional 

supply chain management (SCM) with AI -enabled SCM. The methodology involves a comparative analysis approach, 

systematically evaluating existi ng scholarly articles, industry reports, and case studies to identify key differences in 

efficiency, cost, and adaptability between the two models. By synthesizing findings from peer -reviewed journals, books, 

and reputable databases the study ensures a rob ust foundation for analysis. 

The justification for this methodology lies in its ability to consolidate diverse perspectives without the constraints of 

primary data collection, allowing for broader theoretical insights (Synder, 2019). A literature -based approach is 

particularly suitabl e for emerging fields like AI in SCM, where rapid technological evolution makes longitudinal or 

experimental studies challenging. 

However, the study has limitations. Reliance on secondary data may introduce bias from source selection, and the 

absence of primary research limits granular insights into firm -specific challenges (Baldwin et al., 2022). Additionally, 

the fast -paced nature of AI innovation me ans some findings may quickly become outdated. Despite these constraints, 

the methodology provides a structured, evidence -based comparison that informs both academia and industry on AI’s 

transformative role in SCM. 

# 4 Comparative Analysis 

4.1. Operational Efficiency and Cost Reduction 

4.1.1 Traditional: Manual processes, higher costs, inefficiencies 

Traditional supply chain processes remain fundamentally constrained by their reliance on manual operations, creating 

systemic inefficiencies that permeate every aspect of the value chain (Khedr and Sheeja, 2024). At the core of these 

challenges lies the la bor -intensive nature of critical functions including inventory management, purchase order 

processing, and shipment coordination (Khedr and Sheeja, 2024). Each human touchpoint introduces potential 

bottlenecks, with data entry errors and processing delays b ecoming endemic issues that compound throughout the 

supply network. The absence of automated systems forces personnel to dedicate disproportionate time to 

administrative tasks like paper -based documentation and spreadsheet management, diverting attention f rom higher -

value strategic activities (Xu et al., 2024). Transportation logistics present particular difficulties, with route planning 

often based on static schedules rather than real -time variables, resulting in suboptimal vehicle utilization and excessiv e

fuel expenditures. Warehouse operations similarly suffer from inefficient space utilization and labor allocation, as 

manual stock -keeping methods struggle to maintain accurate inventory records (Wynn, 2021). These operational 

deficiencies manifest in ele vated carrying costs, diminished throughput capacity, and eroding profit margins. Most World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 202 5, 27 (02 ), 1688 -1700 

1692 

critically, the inflexibility of traditional systems severely limits an organization's ability to rapidly scale operations or 

adapt to sudden market shifts, whether demand surges or supply disruptions (Agrawal et al., 2023). The cumulative 

effect is a supp ly chain model that is increasingly untenable in today's fast -paced, data -driven business environment, 

where competitors leveraging digital transformation gain significant advantages in both cost structure and operational 

agility. 

4.2. AI -enabled: Automation, predictive maintenance, cost savings 

In contrast, AI -driven supply chains represent a transformative leap forward in operational efficiency through 

intelligent automation and data -driven optimization. By deploying machine learning algorithms, these advanced 

systems process enormous volumes of structured and unstructured data to uncover hidden inefficiencies and prescribe 

targeted improvements across the entire supply network (Culot et al., 2024). Robotic Process Automation (RPA) 

handles routine transactional work with perfect accuracy, elimina ting human errors in order fulfillment, invoicing, and 

inventory reconciliation while freeing staff for higher -value analytical roles (Venigandla et al., 2023). The integration of 

IoT sensors with AI -powered predictive maintenance creates a self -monitoring ecosystem that can anticipate 

equipment failures days or weeks in advance, scheduling proactive repairs during planned downtime. In transportation 

logistics, AI systems dynamically recalibrate delivery routes by continuously analyzing real -time traffic pa tterns, 

weather conditions, fuel prices, and even driver availability, adjusting plans moment -to -moment to maintain optimal 

efficiency (Onotole et al., 2025). These technological synergies produce compounding

Navigating the complexities of today’s ever-changing, globalized markets continues to pressure “traditional” supply chain practices.

Midway through 2024, we still face economic and geopolitical uncertainty. As-yet unchecked inflation, rising expenses, and ongoing supply scarcity have made it clear that most enterprises need more than just an evolution of their supply chain practices – they need to adapt and transform to keep up with modern business demands. 

The good news? Technology – in the form of AI-enabled workflows and new digitization trends is coming to make your supply chain programs markedly more efficient – all while driving better supplier and consumer relationships. 

And as times and supplier strategies change, procurement leaders need to keep up. We’re here to help. We’ve combed through leading ERP modernization, supply chain, and procurement articles to pull together the 11 most relevant stats – and why they matter.  

If you’re trying to mature and modernize your sourcing and supplier strategies, here’s what you need to know. 

* **40% of Companies Report Increased Sourcing Costs in the Past Year**

Still rebounding from the pandemic, the economic landscape has a direct impact on procurement activities, with many companies experiencing rising costs. According to the Hackett Group, 40% of companies have reported increased sourcing costs over the past year.

Driving this trend are factors including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and increased demand for raw materials. 

This rise in costs poses challenges for procurement professionals, who must balance cost management with the need to maintain quality and supplier relationships. To counteract this, we recommend using omnichannel communications and AI to predict where sourcing costs are headed. From here, workflows (like the ones in modern platform offerings such as ServiceNow) can be developed or adjusted as necessary to improve efficiency.

* **Supporting Procurement is a Lift - Many Companies Dedicate 15% of Their Total Budget Supporting Sourcing and Procurement Programs**

Procurement activities represent a significant portion of a company’s overall budget. According to JPMorgan, businesses allocate an average of 15% of their total budget to procurement, reflecting the strategic importance of sourcing and supplier management.

This substantial investment underscores the need for effective procurement strategies that optimize costs while ensuring the quality and reliability of materials. 

By providing companies and teams with a single lens of their end-to-end procurement experience, ultimately, requests across disparate systems can be consolidated, investments can be optimized, and both employees and suppliers can enjoy a different, more modern layer of engagement.

* **The Average Procurement Professional Spends 2 Hours and 45 Minutes a Day on Sourcing Activities**

In the dynamic world of procurement, sourcing activities are a crucial component of a professional's daily responsibilities. Recent data by the General Office of New York reveals that procurement professionals dedicate an average of 2 hours and 45 minutes each day to sourcing tasks.

The increasing complexity of supply chains necessitates AI-enabled sales and operational planning (S&OP) and integrated business planning (IBP). These advanced technologies enhance predictability and streamline processes by eliminating gaps between planning and execution, thus reducing manual work and leveraging advanced analytics for deeper insights with minimal human intervention. 

As a result, low touch planning not only improves Return on Equity (ROE) by 2 to 4 percentage points but also adds 1 to 3 percent to gross margins across revenue, cost, and assets, according to a 2024 study done by KPMG.

The evolving landscape of supplier sourcing and procurement demands agility, innovation, and strategic partnerships. Through digitalization, prioritizing sustainability, and strengthening supplier relationships, businesses can navigate the complexities of the global market and drive success in the modern era.

As the dynamics of supply chains continue to evolve, staying ahead requires a commitment to adaptation and continuous improvement.

**The most significant challenge in sustainable electronics is balancing cost efficiency with the ethical sourcing of materials, while opportunities lie in leveraging advanced technologies and fostering cross-sector collaborations.**

### Challenges
1. **Material Sourcing and Supply Chain Complexity**: Critical materials like rare earth elements (REEs) and cobalt, essential for electronics, are often sourced from regions with geopolitical instability or poor labor practices. For instance, Nestlé's struggle to ensure deforestation-free soy highlights the complexity of tracing supply chains, a challenge mirrored in electronics sourcing (Procurement Tactics, 2026). Additionally, the lack of transparency in traditional supply chains exacerbates inefficiencies and risks, as noted in McKinsey's analysis of manual tracking systems (McKinsey, 2025).

2. **High Costs of Sustainable Practices**: Transitioning to sustainable materials and processes often increases production costs. For example, implementing low-carbon materials, as mandated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), raises initial expenses but aligns with long-term sustainability goals (ECOR Global, 2025).

3. **Technological and Workforce Gaps**: Adopting advanced technologies like AI and blockchain for supply chain optimization requires significant investment and skilled personnel. A McKinsey survey found that 60% of firms face challenges related to data integration and workforce readiness (McKinsey, 2025).

### Opportunities
1. **Technological Innovations**: AI and IoT can revolutionize supply chain management by enabling real-time tracking and predictive analytics. For example, AI-driven systems have improved demand forecasting accuracy by 20%, reducing overstocking and waste (AI Journal, 2024). Blockchain further enhances transparency, as demonstrated by its use in tracking sustainable aquaculture (Resonance Global, 2022).

2. **Circular Economy Models**: Companies can adopt closed-loop systems to recycle and repurpose materials, reducing waste and dependency on virgin resources. For instance, manufacturers using recycled materials like metals and plastics have significantly lowered their environmental impact (BIM&CO, 2023).

3. **Cross-Sector Partnerships**: Collaborative efforts, such as Tony’s Chocolonely’s Open Chain initiative, show how partnerships can address systemic issues like labor exploitation and material traceability. Similar models could be applied to electronics to ensure ethical sourcing and fair labor practices (Resonance Global, 2022).

4. **Regulatory and Market Incentives**: Policies like the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and consumer demand for sustainable products drive companies to innovate. A Nielsen study found that 66% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products, creating a market advantage for eco-friendly electronics (OptiProERP, 2024).
